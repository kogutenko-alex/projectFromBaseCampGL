# Data Types, Operators and Operations
## Task
Implement a console-based calculator that supports:
- Integer numbers (please, take into account possible overflows)
- Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. Use integer division so that `5 / 2` = 2)
- Parethesis for prioritizing certain expressions (`2 * (3 + 5)` = 16)
- Exponentiation (`3 ^ 3` = 27)

**Important!** Do not use any third-party libraries. Your calculator must be implemented using Java only.

## Format
1. User starts the application
2. Calculator app prints the help message with supported operators
3. User enters the expression (e.g. `7 * ( 8 / (2 + 2) )`)
4. Calculator prints the answer (14)

Possible user inputs are: 
- `4 - ( 9 + 2 )`
- `( 4 - 3 * (7 / 3))`
- `(((9)))`

Invalid user inputs are:
- `0 - 0 (/ 3`
- `4 + 4)`
- `((3)`, etc.

## Error Handling
- If user entered the wrong output (which is possible), calculator should print the `Wrong expression: <Reason>` message, where `<Reason>` is the explanation (for example, division by zero)

## Advanced Task 
For now, calculator must work with integers only. You can add decimal numbers to your implementation.
Use `/` for integer division and `//` for floor division (`5 // 2` = 2.5).

## Notes
- You can use any algorithm for the implementation. One of the most popular methods is using [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). You can find some examples here: https://habr.com/ru/post/282379/
