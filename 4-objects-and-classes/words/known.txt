any

eclipses

predominates
the
whole

abhorrent

his
precise
but
admirably
balanced
he
i
take
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has

as
a
lover
he
would
have
placed
himself

admirable

for
drawing
the
veil

men's
motives
and
but
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce
a
distracting
factor
which
might
throw
a
doubt
upon
all
his
mental
grit
in
a
sensitive
or
a
crack
in
one
of
his
own
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than
a
strong
emotion
in
a
nature
such
as
and
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
and
that
woman
was
the
late
irene
of
dubious
and
questionable
i
had
seen
little
of
holmes
my
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
my
own
complete
and
the
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
while
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
bohemian
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
baker
buried
among
his
old
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
the
drowsiness
of
the
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
he
was
as
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
from
time
to
time
i
heard
some
vague
account
of
his
of
his
summons
to
odessa
in
the
case
of
the
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
atkinson
brothers
at
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
beyond
these
signs
of
his
which
i
merely
shared
with
all
the
readers
of
the
daily
i
knew
little
of
my
former
friend
and
one
was
on
the
twentieth
of
was
returning
from
a
journey
to
a
patient
i
had
now
returned
to
civil
when
my
way
led
me
through
baker
as
i
passed
the
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
study
in
i
was
seized
with
a
keen
desire
to
see
holmes
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
his
rooms
were
brilliantly
even
as
i
looked
i
saw
his
spare
figure
pass
twice
in
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
he
was
pacing
the
room
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
to
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
he
was
at
work
he
had
risen
out
of
his
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
i
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
his
manner
was
not
it
seldom
but
he
was
i
to
see
with
hardly
a
word
but
with
a
kindly
he
waved
me
to
an
threw
across
his
case
of
and
indicated
a
spirit
case
and
a
gasogene
in
the
then
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
suits
he
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and
a
half
pounds
since
i
saw
i
i
should
have
thought
a
little
just
a
trifle
i
and
in
practice
i
you
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
how
do
you
see
i
deduce
how
do
i
know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
and
that
you
have
a
most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
dear
said
is
too
you
would
certainly
have
been
had
you
lived
a
few
centuries
it
is
true
that
i
had
a
country
walk
on
thursday
and
came
home
in
a
dreadful
but
as
i
have
changed
my
clothes
i
can't
imagine
how
you
deduce
as
to
mary
she
is
and
my
wife
has
given
her
but
i
fail
to
see
how
you
work
it

to
himself

his
nervous
hands

me

the
inside
of

left
just
where
the
firelight
strikes

leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
obviously
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
you
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
and
that
you
had
a
particularly
malignant
specimen
of
the
london
as
to
your

gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling

a
black
mark
of

his
right

bulge
on
the
right
side
of

show
where
he
has
secreted

must
be
if
i
do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
i
hear
you
give
your
i
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that
i
could
easily
do
it
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning
i
am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
and
yet
i
believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as

you
do
not

you

yet
you

just

that
there
are
seventeen

i
have
both
seen
and
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little

you
are
good

to

to
consult
you
upon

matter
of
the
very
deepest

recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
europe

shown
that
you
are
one

may
safely

of

less
than
six

inches
in

chest
and

dress

rich

a
richness
which
in
be
looked
upon
as
akin
to
bad
heavy
bands
of
astrakhan

slashed
across
the
sleeves
and
fronts
of
his
while
the
deep
blue
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
lined
with
silk
and
secured
at
the
neck
with
a
brooch
which
consisted
of
a
single
flaming
boots
which
extended
halfway
up

were
trimmed
at
the
tops

barbaric
opulence

that

visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no

depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in

slowly
reopened
his
eyes

impatiently

condescend
to
state

from

paced
up

down

uncontrollable
with
a
gesture

hurled
it

aware
that

duke
of

hereditary
king
of

can
said
our
strange
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
can
understand
that
i
am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
yet
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that
i
could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent
without
putting
myself
in
his

have
come
incognito
from
prague
for
the
purpose
of

five

the

no

familiar

look
her
up
in
my

holmes
without
opening
his

many
years

had
adopted
a
system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men

so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name
a
subject
or
a
person
on
which
he
could
not
at
once

this
case

found
her
biography
sandwiched
in
between
that
of
a
hebrew
rabbi

that
of

heavy
chamois
leather

your
and
i
trust
that
we
shall
soon
have
some
good
news
for
and
he
as
the
wheels
of
the
royal
brougham
rolled
down
the
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
i
should
like
to
chat
this
little
matter
over
with
at
three
o'clock
precisely
i
was
at
baker
but
holmes
had
not
yet
the
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight
o'clock
in
the
i
sat
down
beside
the
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
however
long
he
might
i
was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which
i
have
already
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it
a
character
of
its
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of
a
and
his
incisive
which
made
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
and
to
follow
the
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
so
accustomed
was
i
to
his
invariable
success
that
the
very
possibility
of
his
failing
had
ceased
to
enter
into
my
it
was
close
upon
four
before
the
door
and
a
and
with
an
inflamed
face
and
disreputable
walked
into
the
accustomed
as
i
was
to
my
friend's
amazing
powers
in
the
use
of
i
had
to
look
three
times
before
i
was
certain
that
it
was
indeed
with
a
nod
he
vanished
into
the
whence
he
emerged
in
five
minutes
and
as
of
putting
his
hands
into
his
he
stretched
out
his
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
he
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
limp
and
in
the
is
quite
too
i
am
sure
you
could
never
guess
how
i
employed
my
or
what
i
ended
by
can't
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
watching
the
and
perhaps
the
of
miss
irene
but
the
sequel
was
rather
i
will
tell
i
left
the
house
a
little
after
eight
o'clock
this
morning
in
the
character
of
a
groom
out
of
there
is
a
wonderful
sympathy
and
freemasonry
among
horsey
be
one
of
and
you
will
know
all
that
there
is
to
i
soon
found
briony
it
is
a
bijou
with
a
garden
at
the
but
built
out
in
front
right
up
to
the
two
chubb
lock
to
the
large
on
the
right
well
with
long
windows
almost
to
the
and
those
preposterous
english
window
fasteners
which
a
child
could
behind
there
was
nothing
save
that
the
passage
window
could
be
reached
from
the
top
of
the
i
walked
round
it
and
examined
it
closely
from
every
point
of
but
without
noting
anything
else
of
then
lounged
down
the
street
and
as
i
that
there
was
a
mews
in
a
lane
which
runs
down
by
one
wall
of
the
i
lent
the
a
hand
in
rubbing
down
their
and
received
in
exchange
a
glass
of
half
and
two
fills
of
shag
and
as
much
information
as
i
could
desire
about
miss
to
say
nothing
of
half
a
dozen
other
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
whom
i
was
not
in
the
least
but
whose
biographies
i
was
compelled
to
listen
what
of
irene
i
she
has
turned
all
the
men's
heads
down
in
that
she
is
the
thing
under
a
bonnet
on
this
so
say
the
to
a
she
lives
sings
at
drives
out
at
five
every
and
returns
at
seven
sharp
for
seldom
goes
out
at
other
except
when
she
has
only
one
male
but
a
good
deal
of
he
is
and
never
calls
less
than
once
a
and
often
he
is
a
godfrey
of
the
inner
see
the
advantages
of
a
cabman
as
a
they
had
driven
him
home
a
dozen
times
from
and
knew
all
about
when
i
had
listened
to
all
they
had
to
i
began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
briony
lodge
once
and
to
think
over
my
plan
of
godfrey
norton
was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
he
was
a
that
sounded
what
was
the
relation
between
and
what
the
object
of
his
repeated
was
she
his
his
or
his
if
the
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
if
the
it
was
less
on
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether
i
should
continue
my
work
at
briony
or
turn
my
attention
to
the
chambers
in
the
it
was
a
delicate
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
i
fear
that
i
bore
you
with
these
but
i
have
to
let
you
see
my
little
if
you
are
to
understand
the
am
following
you
i
was
still
balancing
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
a
hansom
cab
drove
up
to
briony
and
a
gentleman
sprang
he
was
a
remarkably
handsome
and
evidently
the
man
of
whom
i
had
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
great
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
thoroughly
at
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
and
i
could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
pacing
up
and
talking
and
waving
his
of
her
i
could
see
presently
he
looking
even
more
flurried
than
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
he
pulled
a
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
like
the
he
to
gross
in
regent
and
then
to
the
church
of
monica
in
the
half
a
guinea
if
you
do
it
in
twenty
they
and
i
was
just
wondering
whether
i
should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came
a
neat
little
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
and
his
tie
under
his
while
all
the
tags
of
his
harness
were
sticking
out
of
the
it
hadn't
pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the
hall
door
and
into
i
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
at
the
but
she
was
a
lovely
with
a
face
that
a
man
might
die
church
of
she
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
was
quite
too
good
to
i
was
just
balancing
whether
i
should
run
for
or
whether
i
should
perch
behind
her
landau
when
a
cab
came
through
the
the
driver
looked
twice
at
such
a
shabby
but
i
jumped
in
before
he
could
church
of
said
half
a
sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
it
was
minutes
to
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
cabby
drove
i
don't
think
i
ever
drove
but
the
others
were
there
before
the
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when
i
i
paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
there
was
not
a
soul
there
save
the
two
whom
i
had
followed
and
a
who
seemed
to
be
with
they
were
all
three
standing
in
a
knot
in
front
of
the
i
lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into
a
to
my
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
and
godfrey
norton
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
he
i
only
three
or
it
won't
be
was
up
to
the
and
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
and
vouching
for
things
of
which
i
knew
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
irene
to
godfrey
it
was
all
done
in
an
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
it
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which
i
ever
found
myself
in
my
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
it
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without
a
witness
of
some
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of
a
best

bride
gave
me
a

i
mean
to
wear
it
on
my

memory

the

a
very
unexpected
turn
of
said
what
i
found
my
plans
very
seriously

looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate

prompt

energetic

lost

when
he
became
a
specialist
in

a
quarter
past
six
when
we
left
baker
and
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in

it
was
already
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted
as
we
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
briony
waiting
for
the
coming
of

the
house
was
just
such
as
i
had
pictured
it
from
sherlock
succinct
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than
i
on
the
for
a
small
street
in
a
quiet
it
was
remarkably
there
was
a
group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in
a
a
with
his
two
who
were
flirting
with
a
and
several
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars

we

the

the
chances
are
that

would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
godfrey
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
now
the
question
where
are
we
to
find
the
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
it
is
cabinet
too
large
for
easy
concealment
about
a
woman's
she
knows
that
the
king
is
capable
of
having
her
waylaid
and
two
attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
we
may
take
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
banker
or
her
there
is
that
double
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
women
are
naturally
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
why
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
she
could
trust
her
own
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon
a
business
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within
a
few
it
must
be
where
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon

not
know
how

her

of
earning

was
elbowed
away
by
another
who
had
rushed
up
with
the

a
fierce
quarrel
broke

was
increased
by
the
two
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
and
by
the
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other

blow

in
an
instant
the
who
had
stepped
from

the
centre
of
a
little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other

their
fists

dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect

as

reached
her

gave
a
cry

up
the
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
looking
back
into
the
the
poor
gentleman
much
she
is
cried
several
there's
life
in
shouted
he'll
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
a

said
a
would
have
had
the
lady's
purse
and
watch
if
it
hadn't
been
for
they
were
a
and
a
rough
he's
breathing
can't
lie
in
the
may
we
bring
him
bring
him
into
the
there
is
a
comfortable
this
slowly
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
briony
lodge
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
while
i
still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
the
lamps
had
been
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
so
that
i
could
see
holmes
as
he
lay
upon
the
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
but
i
know
that
i
never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when
i
saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom
i
was
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
and
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
holmes
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
to
i
hardened
my
and
took
the
from
under
my
after
i
we
are
not
injuring
we
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
holmes
had
sat
up
upon
the
and
i
saw
him
motion
like
a
man
who
is
in
need
of
a
maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
at
the
same
instant
i
saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal
i
tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with
a
cry
of
the
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
well
dressed
and
and
in
a
general
shriek
of
thick
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
rushing
and
a
moment
later
the
voice
of
holmes
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was
a
false
slipping
through
the
shouting
crowd
i
made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend's
arm
in
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
he
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
did
it
very
he
could
have
been
it
is
all
have
the
know
where
it
how
did
you
find
showed
as
i
told
you
she
am
still
in
the
do
not
wish
to
make
a
said
matter
was
perfectly
of
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
they
were
all
engaged
for
the
guessed
as
when
the
row
broke
i
had
a
little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
i
rushed
fell
clapped
my
hand
to
my
and
became
a
piteous
it
is
an
old
also
i
could
they
carried
me
she
was
bound
to
have
me
what
else
could
she
and
into
her
which
was
the
very
room
which
i
it
lay
between
that
and
her
and
i
was
determined
to
see
they
laid
me
on
a
i
motioned
for
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
and
you
had
your
did
that
help
was
when
a
woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
it
is
a
perfectly
overpowering
and
i
have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
in
the
case
of
the
darlington
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
and
also
in
the
castle
a
married
woman
grabs
at
her
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
now
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
she
would
rush
to
secure
the
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
the
smoke
and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
she
responded
the
photograph
is
in
a
recess
behind
a
sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
she
was
there
in
an
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
as
she
it
when
i
cried
out
that
it
was
a
false
she
replaced
glanced
at
the
rushed
from
the
and
i
have
not
seen
her
i
making
my
escaped
from
the
i
hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
but
the
coachman
had
come
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
a
little
may
ruin
i
quest
is
practically
i
shall
call
with
the
king
and
with
if
you
care
to
come
with
we
will
be
shown
into
the
to
wait
for
the
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
it
might
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
majesty
to
regain
it
with
his
own
when
will
you
eight
in
the
she
will
not
be
so
that
we
shall
have
a
clear
we
must
be
for
this
marriage
may
mean
a
complete
change
in
her
life
and
i
must
wire
to
the
king
without
we
had
reached
baker
street
and
had
stopped
at
the
he
was
searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
mister
sherlock
there
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from
a
slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
heard
that
voice
said
staring
down
the
dimly
lit
i
wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
i
slept
at
baker
street
that
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the
king
of
bohemia
rushed
into
the
have
really
got
he
grasping
sherlock
holmes
by
either
shoulder
and
looking
eagerly
into
his
you
have
have
i
am
all
impatience
to
be
must
have
a
my
brougham
is
that
will
simplify
we
descended
and
started
off
once
more
for
briony
adler

remarked
to
an
english
lawyer
named
she
could
not
love
am
in
hopes
that
she
why
in
it
would
spare
your
majesty
all
fear
of
future
if
the
lady
loves
her
she
does
not
love
your
if
she
does
not
love
your
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interfere
with
your
majesty's
is
and
i
wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
what
a
queen
she
would
have
he
relapsed
into
a
moody
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
serpentine
the
door
of
briony
lodge
was
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
she
watched
us
with
a
sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
sherlock
i
said
am
answered
my
looking
at
her
with
a
questioning
and
rather
startled
my
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
she
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
train
from
charing
cross
for
the
sherlock
holmes
staggered
white
with
chagrin
and
you
mean
that
she
has
left
to
the
asked
the
king
is
shall
he
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
followed
by
the
king
and
the
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
every
with
dismantled
shelves
and
open
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
holmes
rushed
at
the
tore
back
a
small
sliding
plunging
in
his
pulled
out
a
photograph
and
a
the
photograph
was
of
irene
adler
herself
in
evening
the
letter
was
to
to
be
left
till
called
my
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
it
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
dear
sherlock
really
did
it
very
you
took
me
in
until
after
the
alarm
of
i
had
not
a
but
when
i
found
how
i
had
betrayed
i
began
to
i
had
been
warned
against
you
months
i
had
been
told
that
if
the
king
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
and
your
address
had
been
given
with
all
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
even
after
i
became
i
found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such
a
kind
old
you
i
have
been
trained
as
an
actress
male
costume
is
nothing
new
to
i
often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
i
sent
the
to
watch
ran
up
got
into
my
as
i
call
and
came
down
just
as
you
i
followed
you
to
your
and
so
made
sure
that
i
was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
sherlock
then
rather
wished
you
and
started
for
the
temple
to
see
my
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
as
to
the
your
client
may
rest
in
i
love
and
am
loved
by
a
better
man
than
the
king
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
i
keep
it
only
to
safeguard
and
to
preserve
a
weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
i
leave
a
photograph
which
he
might
care
to
and
i
dear
sherlock
truly
a
what
a
cried
the
king
of
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
i
not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
would
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
is
it
not
a
pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
what
i
have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on
a
very
different
level
to
your
said
holmes
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
majesty's
business
to
a
more
successful
the
my
dear
cried
the
could
be
more
i
know
that
her
word
is
the
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
am
glad
to
hear
your
majesty
say
am
immensely
indebted
to
pray
tell
me
in
what
way
i
can
reward
this
he
slipped
an
emerald
snake
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
majesty
has
something
which
i
should
value
even
more
said
have
but
to
name
the
king
stared
at
him
in
he
if
you
wish
thank
your
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
very
he
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
king
had
stretched
out
to
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
and
that
was
how
a
great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
and
how
the
best
plans
of
sherlock
holmes
were
beaten
by
a
woman's
he
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
but
i
have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
and
when
he
speaks
of
irene
or
when
he
refers
to
her
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of
the
adventure
the
league
i
had
called
upon
my
sherlock
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with
a
very
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
with
an
apology
for
my
i
was
about
to
withdraw
when
holmes
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
could
not
possibly
have
come
at
a
better
my
dear
he
said
was
afraid
that
you
were
i
very
much
i
can
wait
in
the
next
at
this
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
the
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
a
bob
of
with
a
quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
the
said
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
my
dear
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
you
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
i
will
remember
that
i
remarked
the
other
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
miss
mary
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
proposition
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
for
otherwise
i
shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
wilson
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
and
to
begin
a
narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which
i
have
listened
to
for
some
you
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
and
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
as
far
as
i
have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that
i
have
ever
listened
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
i
ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
watson
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
as
a
when
i
have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
i
am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
in
the
present
instance
i
am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
to
the
best
of
my
the
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled
a
dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
as
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
i
took
a
good
look
at
the
man
and
after
the
fashion
of
my
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
i
did
not
gain
very
by
my
our
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
british
and
he
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd's
check
a
not
black
unbuttoned
in
the
and
a
drab
waistcoat
with
a
heavy
brassy
albert
and
a
square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
a
frayed
and
a
faded
brown
overcoat
with
a
wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon
a
chair
beside
look
as
i
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
sherlock
quick
eye
took
in
my
and
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
that
he
takes
that
he
is
a
that
he
has
been
in
and
that
he
has
done
a
considerable
amount
of
writing
i
can
deduce
nothing
wilson
started
up
in
his
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
but
his
eyes
upon
my
in
the
name
of

you
know
all
he
did
you
for
that
i
did
manual
it's
as
true
as
for
i
began
as
a
ship's
my
dear
your
right
hand
is
quite
a
size
larger
than
your
you
have
worked
with
and
the
muscles
are
more
the
and
the
won't
insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how
i
read
especially
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
you
use
an
of
i
forgot
but
the
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
but
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
i
have
made
a
small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
that
trick
of
staining
the
scales
of
a
delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
in
i
see
a
chinese
coin
hanging
from
your
the
matter
becomes
even
more
wilson
laughed
i
said
thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
but
i
see
that
there
was
nothing
in
after
begin
to
said
i
make
a

what
began

it
for
i

ejaculated
after
i
had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
holmes

and
wriggled

first
make
a
of
the
paper
and
the

the
morning
chronicle
of
april
just
two
months
it
is
just
as
i
have
been
telling
sherlock

mopping
his
have
a
small
pawnbroker's
business
at
coburg
near
the
it's
not
a
very
large
and
of
late
years
it
has
not
done
more
than
just
give
me
a
i
used
to
be
able
to
keep
two
but
now
i
only
keep
and
i
would
have
a
job
to
pay
him
but
that
he
is
willing
to
come
for
half
wages
so
as
to
learn
the
is
the
name
of
this
obliging
asked
sherlock
name
is
vincent
and
he's
not
such
a
it's
hard
to
say
his
i
should
not
wish
a
smarter
and
i
know
very
well
that
he
could
better
himself
and
earn
twice
what
i
am
able
to
give
after
if
he
is
why
should
i
put
ideas
in
his
you
seem
most
fortunate
in
having
an
who
comes
under
the
full
market
it
is
not
a
common
experience
among
employers
in
this
i
don't
know
that
your
assistant
is
not
as
remarkable
as
your
he
has
his
said
was
such
a
fellow
for
snapping
away
with
a
camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like
a
rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
that
is
his
main
but
on
the
whole
he's
a
good
there's
no
vice
in
is
still
with
i
he
and
a
girl
of
who
does
a
bit
of
simple
cooking
and
keeps
the
place
all
i
have
in
the
for
i
am
a
widower
and
never
had
any
we
live
very
the
three
of
and
we
keep
a
roof
over
our
heads
and
pay
our
if
we
do
nothing
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
with
this
very
paper
in
his
and
he
wish
to
the
that
i
was
a
i
says
another
vacancy
on
the
league
of
the
it's
worth
quite
a
little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
and
i
understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
end
what
to
do
with
the
if
my
hair
would
only
change
here's
a
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
what
is
i
you
i
am
a
very
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
i
was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
in
that
way
i
didn't
know
much
of
what
was
going
on
and
i
was
always
glad
of
a
bit
of
you
never
heard
of
the
league
of
the
he
asked
with
his
eyes
i
wonder
at
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
what
are
they
i
merely
a
couple
of
hundred
a
but
the
work
is
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with
one's
other
you
can
easily
think
that
that
made
me
prick
up
my
for
the
business
has
not
been
for
some
and
an
extra
couple
of
hundred
would
have
been
very
me
all
about
said
said
showing
me
the
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
league
has
a
and
there
is
the
address
where
you
should
apply
for
as
far
as
i
can
make
the
league
was
founded
by
an
american
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
he
was
himself
and
he
had
a
great
sympathy
for
all
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
from
all
i
hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
said
would
be
millions
of
men
who
would
so
many
as
you
might
he
see
it
is
really
confined
to
and
to
grown
this
american
had
started
from
london
when
he
was
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town
a
good
i
have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
or
dark
or
anything
but
real
fiery
if
you
cared
to
you
would
just
walk
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of
a
few
hundred
it
is
a
as
you
may
see
for
that
my
hair
is
of
a
very
full
and
rich
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter
i
stood
as
good
a
chance
as
any
man
that
i
had
ever
vincent
spaulding
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that
i
thought
he
might
prove
so
i
just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
he
was
very
willing
to
have
a
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
never
hope
to
see
such
a
sight
as
that
from
and
west
every
man
who
had
a
shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
fleet
street
was
choked
with
and
pope's
court
looked
like
a
orange
i
should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
every
shade
of
colour
they
as
spaulding
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
when
i
saw
how
many
were
i
would
have
given
it
up
in
but
spaulding
would
not
hear
of
how
he
did
it
i
could
not
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
there
was
a
double
stream
upon
the
some
going
up
in
and
some
coming
back
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
experience
has
been
a
most
entertaining
remarked
holmes
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with
a
huge
pinch
of
continue
your
very
interesting
was
nothing
in
the
office
but
a
couple
of
wooden
chairs
and
a
deal
behind
which
sat
a
small
man
with
a
head
that
was
even
redder
than
he
said
a
few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
getting
a
vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such
a
very
easy
after
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
so
that
he
might
have
a
private
word
with
is
said
my
he
is
willing
to
fill
a
vacancy
in
the
he
is
admirably
suited
for
the
other
has
every
i
cannot
recall
when
i
have
seen
anything
so
he
took
a
step
cocked
his
head
on
one
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until
i
felt
quite
then
suddenly
he
plunged
wrung
my
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
would
be
injustice
to
said
i
am
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
with
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
and
tugged
until
i
yelled
with
the
is
water
in
your
said
he
as
he
released
perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
but
we
have
to
be
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
i
could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler's
wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
he
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
a
groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not
a
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
said
duncan
and
i
am
myself
one
of
the
pensioners
upon
the
fund
left
by
our
noble
are
you
a
married
have
you
a
answered
that
i
had
face
fell
he
said
is
very
serious
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
the
fund
of
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
as
well
as
for
their
it
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be
a
face
lengthened
at
for
i
thought
that
i
was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
but
after
thinking
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
the
case
of
said
objection
might
be
but
we
must
stretch
a
point
in
favour
of
a
man
with
such
a
head
of
hair
as
when
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
it
is
a
little
for
i
have
a
business
said
never
mind
about
said
vincent
should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
would
be
the
i
to
a
pawnbroker's
business
is
mostly
done
of
an
especially
thursday
and
friday
which
is
just
before
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn
a
little
in
the
i
knew
that
my
assistant
was
a
good
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
would
suit
me
very
said
the
pounds
a
the
purely
do
you
call
purely
you
have
to
be
in
the
or
at
least
in
the
the
whole
if
you
you
forfeit
your
whole
position
the
will
is
very
clear
upon
that
you
don't
comply
with
the
conditions
if
you
budge
from
the
office
during
that
only
four
hours
a
and
i
should
not
think
of
said
excuse
will
said
duncan
sickness
nor
business
nor
anything
there
you
must
or
you
lose
your
the
to
copy
out
the
there
is
the
first
volume
of
it
in
that
you
must
find
your
own
and
but
we
provide
this
table
and
will
you
be
ready
i
and
let
me
congratulate
you
once
more
on
the
important
position
which
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
he
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and
i
went
home
with
my
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
i
was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
i
thought
over
the
matter
all
and
by
evening
i
was
in
low
spirits
for
i
had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
though
what
its
object
might
be
i
could
not
it
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such
a
or
that
they
would
pay
such
a
sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
vincent
spaulding
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
but
by
bedtime
i
had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
in
the
morning
i
determined
to
have
a
look
at
it
so
i
bought
a
penny
bottle
of
and
with
a
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
i
started
off
for
pope's
to
my
surprise
and
everything
was
as
right
as
the
table
was
set
out
ready
for
and
duncan
ross
was
there
to
see
that
i
got
fairly
to
he
started
me
off
upon
the
letter
and
then
he
left
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
at
two
o'clock
he
bade
me
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that
i
had
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
went
on
day
after
and
on
saturday
the
manager
came
in
and
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week's
it
was
the
same
next
and
the
same
the
week
every
morning
i
was
there
at
and
every
afternoon
i
left
at
by
degrees
duncan
ross
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of
a
and
after
a
he
did
not
come
in
at
of
i
never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
for
i
was
not
sure
when
he
might
and
the
billet
was
such
a
good
and
suited
me
so
that
i
would
not
risk
the
loss
of
weeks
passed
away
like
and
i
had
written
about
abbots
and
archery
and
armour
and
architecture
and
and
hoped
with
diligence
that
i
might
get
on
to
the
before
very
it
cost
me
something
in
and
i
had
pretty
nearly
filled
a
shelf
with
my
and
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
an
and
no
later
than
this
i
went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten
but
the
door
was
shut
and
with
a
little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with
a
here
it
and
you
can
read
for
he
held
up
a
piece
of
white
cardboard
about
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
it
read
in
this
the
league
is
october
sherlock
holmes
and
i
surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
cannot
see
that
there
is
anything
very
cried
our
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
i
can
go
cried
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
really
wouldn't
miss
your
case
for
the
it
is
most
refreshingly
but
there
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
something
just
a
little
funny
about
pray
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
was
i
did
not
know
what
to
then
i
called
at
the
offices
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
i
went
to
the
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
and
i
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
he
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
then
i
asked
him
who
duncan
ross
he
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
said
gentleman
at
the
said
name
was
william
he
was
a
solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as
a
temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
he
moved
out
could
i
find
at
his
new
he
did
tell
me
the
king
edward
near
started
but
when
i
got
to
that
address
it
was
a
manufactory
of
artificial
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
william
morris
or
duncan
what
did
you
do
asked
went
home
to
and
i
took
the
advice
of
my
but
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
he
could
only
say
that
if
i
waited
i
should
hear
by
but
that
was
not
quite
good
i
did
not
wish
to
lose
such
a
place
without
a
as
i
had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
i
came
right
away
to
you
did
very
said
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
look
into
from
what
you
have
told
me
i
think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
said
i
have
lost
four
pound
a
far
as
you
are
personally
remarked
do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
on
the
you
as
i
richer
by
some
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter
you
have
lost
nothing
by
but
i
want
to
find
out
about
and
who
they
and
what
their
object
was
in

expensive

these

two
this

yours

called
your
attention
to
the
long
had

quick

though
he's
not
short
of

a
white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
thought
as
said
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
he
told
me
that
a
gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was
a
said

in
deep

much

shall
be
happy
to
give

an
opinion
upon
the
subject

the
course
of
a
day
or
is
and
i
hope
that
by
monday
we
may
come
to
a
said
holmes
when
our
visitor
had
left
do
you
make
of
it
make
nothing
of
i
answered
is
a
most
mysterious
a
said
more
bizarre
a
thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
it
is
your
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
just
as
a
commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
but
i
must
be
prompt
over
this
are
you
going
to
i
he
is
quite
a
three
pipe
and
i
beg
that
you
won't
speak
to
me
for
fifty
he
curled
himself
up
in
his
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
and
indeed
was
nodding
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
plays
at
the
hall
this
he
do
you
could
your
patients
spare
you
for
a
few
have
nothing
to
do
my
practice
is
never
very
put
on
your
hat
and
i
am
going
through
the
city
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
i
observe
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
german
music
on
the
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
italian
or
it
is
and
i
want
to
come
we
travelled
by
the
underground
as
far
as
and
a
short
walk
took
us
to
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
it
was
a
where
four
lines
of
dingy
brick
houses
looked
out
into
a
small
where
a
lawn
of
weedy
grass
and
a
few
clumps
of
faded
made
a
hard
fight
against
a
and
uncongenial
three
gilt
balls
and
a
brown
board
with
in
white
upon
a
corner
announced
the
place
where
our
client
carried
on
his
sherlock
holmes
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
then
he
walked
slowly
up
the
and
then
down
again
to
the
still
looking
keenly
at
the
finally
he
returned
to
the
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
it
was
instantly
opened
by
a
young
who
asked
him
to
step
said
only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
fourth
answered
the
assistant
closing
the
observed
holmes
as
we
walked
in
my
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
and
for
daring
i
am
not
sure
that
he
has
not
a
claim
to
be
i
have
known
something
of
him
said
wilson's
assistant
counts
for
a
good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
i
am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
knees
of
his
what
did
you
i
expected
to
did
you
beat
the
dear
this
is
a
time
for
not
for
we
are
spies
in
an
enemy's
we
know
something
of
let
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
the
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
square
presented
as
great
a
contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of
a
picture
does
to
the
it
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
city
to
the
north
and
the
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in
a
double
tide
inward
and
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
it
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
me
said
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
it
is
a
hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
there
is
the
the
little
newspaper
the
coburg
branch
of
the
city
and
suburban
the
vegetarian
and
that
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
and
we've
done
our
so
it's
time
we
had
some
a
sandwich
and
a
cup
of
and
then
off
to
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
and
there
are
no
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
my
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
being
himself
not
only
a
very
capable
performer
but
a
composer
of
no
ordinary
all
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
gently
waving
his
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
holmes
the
holmes
the
criminal
as
it
was
possible
to
in
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
as
i
have
often
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
the
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
as
i
knew
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
for
days
on
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
then
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on
a
man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
when
i
saw
him
that
afternoon
so
in
the
music
at
hall
i
felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
want
to
go
no
he
remarked
as
we
it
would
be
as
i
have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
this
business
at
coburg
square
is
considerable
crime
is
in
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
but
being
saturday
rather
complicates
i
shall
want
your
help
what
will
be
early
shall
be
at
baker

there
may
be
some
little
so
kindly
put
your

waved
his
turned
on
his
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
i
trust
that
i
am
not
more
dense
than
my
but
i
was
always
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
sherlock
here
i
had
heard
what
he
had
i
had
seen
what
he
had
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
as
i
drove
home
to
my
house
in
kensington
i
thought
over
it
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
copier
of
the
down
to
the
visit
to
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
what
was
this
nocturnal
and
why
should
i
go
where
were
we
and
what
were
we
to
i
had
the
hint
from
holmes
that
this
pawnbroker's
assistant
was
a
formidable
man
who
might
play
a
deep
i
tried
to
puzzle
it
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
it
was
a
nine
when
i
started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
and
so
through
oxford
street
to
baker
two
were
standing
at
the
and
as
i
entered
the
passage
i
heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
on
entering
his
room
i
found
holmes
in
animated
conversation
with
two
one
of
whom
i
recognised
as
peter
the
official
police
while
the
other
was
a
with
a
very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
our
party
is
said
buttoning
up
his
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
i
think
you
know
of
scotland
let
me
introduce
you
to
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
hunting
in
couples
you
said
jones
in
his
consequential
friend
here
is
a
wonderful
man
for
starting
a
all
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
hope
a
wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
observed
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
said
the
police
agent
has
his
own
little
which
if
he
won't
mind
my
saying
just
a
little
too
theoretical
and
but
he
has
the
makings
of
a
detective
in
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
as
in
that
business
of
the
murder
and
the
agra
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
if
you
say
it
is
all
said
the
stranger
with
i
confess
that
i
miss
my
it
is
the
first
saturday
night
for
years
that
i
have
not
had
my
think
you
will
said
sherlock
you
will
play
for
a
higher
stake
than
you
have
ever
done
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
for
the
stake
will
be
some
and
for
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
the
and
he's
a
young
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
and
i
would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
he's
a
remarkable
is
young
john
his
grandfather
was
a
royal
and
he
himself
has
been
to
eton
and
his
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
he'll
crack
a
crib
in
scotland
one
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
cornwall
the
i've
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
hope
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
i've
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
john
and
i
agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his

is
past
and

you

communicative

drive

back
in

cab

the
tunes

had

in
the
we
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
streets

we
emerged
into

close

fellow

personally
interested
in

it
as
well
to
have
jones
with
us
he
is
not
a
bad
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
he
has
one
positive
he
is
as
brave
as
a
bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as
a
lobster

he
gets
his
claws

down

narrow
passage

was

in

very
massive

down

flight
of
winding

reasons

warnings

occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose

well

that
we

within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to

we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
sit
in

afraid
i
had
brought
a
pack
of
cards
in
my
and
i
thought
as
we
were
a
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
but
i
see
that
the
enemy's
preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
cannot
risk
the
presence
of
a
first
of
we
must
choose
our
these
are
daring
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at
a
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
i
shall
stand
behind
this
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
when
i
flash
a
light
upon
close
in
if
they
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
i
placed
my
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which
i
holmes
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
an
absolute
darkness
as
i
have
never
before
the
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
ready
to
flash
out
at
a
moment's
to
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
have
but
one
whispered
is
back
through
the
house
into
i
hope
that
you
have
done
what
i
asked
have
an
inspector
and
two
officers
waiting
at
the
front
we
have
stopped
all
the
and
now
we
must
be
silent
and
what
a
time
it
from
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and
a
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
my
limbs
were
weary
and
for
i
feared
to
change
my
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that
i
could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
but
i
could
distinguish
the
heavier
of
the
bulky
jones
from
the
sighing
note
of
the
bank
from
my
position
i
could
look
over
the

in
the
direction
of

suddenly
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of
a
at
first
it
was
but
a
lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
then
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became
a
yellow
and
without
any
warning
or
a
gash
seemed
to
open
and
a
hand
a
almost
womanly
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
for
a
minute
or
more
the
with
its
writhing
protruded
out
of
the
then
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked
a
chink
between
the

with
a
tearing
one
of
the
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left
a
gaping
through
which
streamed
the
light
of
a
over
the
edge
there
peeped
a
boyish
which
looked
keenly
about
and
with
a
hand
on
either
side
of
the
drew
itself
and
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
in
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him
a
lithe
and
small
like
with
a
pale
face
and
a
shock
of
very
red
all

and
the

i'll
swing
for
sherlock
holmes
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
the
other
dived
down
the
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
jones
clutched
at
his
the
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of
a
but
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man's
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
no
john
said
holmes

no

the

answered
with
the
utmost
fancy
that
my
pal
is
all
though
i
see
you
have
got
his

three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
said
you
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
i
must
compliment
i
holmes
idea
was
very
new
and
see
your
pal
again
said
quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than
i
just
hold
out
while
i
fix
the
beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy

our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
may
not
be
aware
that
i
have
royal
blood
in
my

the
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
and
said
jones
with
a
stare
and
a
would
you
march
where
we
can
get
a
cab
to
carry
your
highness
to
the
is
said
john
clay
he
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
said
as
we
followed
them
from
the
do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my

had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
john
said
have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
which
i
shall
expect
the
bank
to
but
beyond
that
i
am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over
a
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
baker
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
and
the
copying
of
the
must
be
to
get
this
not
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for
a
number
of
hours
every
it
was
a
curious
way
of
managing
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest
a
the
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
clay's
ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
the
pounds
a
week
was
a
lure
which
must
draw
and
what
was
it
to
who
were
playing
for
they
put
in
the
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
from
the
time
that
i
heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
there
been
women
in
the
i
should
have
suspected
a
mere
vulgar
was
out
of
the
the
man's
business
was
a
small
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
it
be
something
out
of
the
what
could
it
i
thought
of
the
assistant's
fondness
for
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
the
there
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
then
i
made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that
i
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
he
was
doing
something
in
the
which
took
many
hours
a
day
for
months
on
what
could
it
once
i
could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running
a
tunnel
to
some
other
far
i
had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
i
surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
i
was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
it
was
not
in
then
i
rang
the
as
i
the
assistant
answered
we
have
had
some
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
i
hardly
looked
at
his
his
knees
were
what
i
wished
to
you
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
and
stained
they
they
spoke
of
those
hours
of
the
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
i
walked
round
the
saw
the
city
and
suburban
bank
abutted
on
our
friend's
and
felt
that
i
had
solved
my
when
you
drove
home
after
the
concert
i
called
upon
scotland
yard
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
with
the
result
that
you
have
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
i
when
they
closed
their
league
offices
that
was
a
sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
wilson's
other
that
they
had
completed
their
but
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
as
it
might
be
or
the
bullion
might
be
saturday
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
for
all
these
reasons
i
expected
them
to
come
reasoned
it
out
i
exclaimed
in
unfeigned
is
so
long
a
and
yet
every
link
rings
saved
me
from
he
i
already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
my
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
these
little
problems

me
to
do

a
benefactor
of

risen
from

was
standing
between
the
parted
blinds
gazing
down
into
the
dull
london
looking
over
his
i
saw
that
on
the
pavement
opposite
there
stood
a
large
woman
with
a
heavy
fur
boa
round
her
and
a
large
curling
red
feather
in
a
hat
which
was
tilted
in
a
coquettish
duchess
of
devonshire
fashion
over
her
from
under
this
great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in
a
hesitating
fashion
at
our
while
her
body
oscillated
backward
and
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove
with
a

of
the
swimmer
who
leaves

hurried
across

heard

sharp
clang
of

symptoms

the
pavement

means
an
affaire

she
would
like
but
is
not
sure
that
the
matter
is
not
too
delicate
for
and
yet
even
here
we
may
when
a
woman
has
been
seriously
wronged
by
a
man
she
no
longer
and
the
usual
symptom
is
a
broken
bell
here
we
may
take
it
that
there
is
a
love
but
that
the
maiden
is
not
so
much
angry
as
or
but
here
she
comes
in
person
to
resolve
our

he
spoke
there
was
a
tap
at
the
and
the
boy
in
buttons
entered
to
announce
miss
mary
while
the
lady
herself
loomed
behind
his
small
black
figure
like
a
behind
a
tiny
pilot
sherlock
holmes
welcomed
her
with
the
easy
courtesy
for
which
he
was
having
closed
the
door
and
bowed
her
into
an
he
looked
her
over
in
the
minute
and
yet
abstracted
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
you
not
he
with
your
short
sight
it
is
a
little
trying
to
do
so
much
did
at

know
where
the

are

realising
the
full
purport
of

gave
a
violent
start
and
looked
with
fear
and
astonishment
upon
her
heard
about
she
how
could
you
know
all
said
is
my
business
to
know
perhaps
i
have
trained
myself
to
see
what
others
if
why
should
you
come
to
consult
came
to
because
i
heard
of
you
from
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
i
wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
i'm
not
but
still
i
have
a
hundred
a
year
in
my
own
besides
the
little
that
i
make
by
the
and
i
would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such
a
asked
sherlock
with
his
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
again
a
startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
miss
mary
i
did
bang
out
of
the
she
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
my
it
he
would
not
go
to
the
and
he
would
not
go
to
and
so
at
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
it
made
me
and
i
just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
said
since
the
name
is
my
i
call
him
though
it
sounds
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
your
mother
is
mother
is
alive
and
i
wasn't
best
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father's
and
a
man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
father
was
a
plumber
in
the
court
and
he
left
a
tidy
business
behind
which
mother
carried
on
with
the
but
when
came
he
made
her
sell
the
for
he
was
very
being
a
traveller
in
they
got
pounds
for
the
goodwill
and
which
wasn't
near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
i
had
expected
to
see
sherlock
holmes
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
on
the
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
own
little
he
it
come
out
of
the
it
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
ned
in
it
is
in
new
zealand
paying
per
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
but
i
can
only
touch
the
interest
me
said
since
you
draw
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
a
with
what
you
earn
into
the
you
no
doubt
travel
a
little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
i
believe
that
a
single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about
could
do
with
much
less
than
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as
i
live
at
home
i
don't
wish
to
be
a
burden
to
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while
i
am
staying
with
of
that
is
only
just
for
the
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
and
i
find
that
i
can
do
pretty
well
with
what
i
earn
at
it

me

i
can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in
a

made
your
position
very
clear
to

my
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
kindly
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
a
flush
stole
over
miss
sutherland's
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
met
him
first
at
the
she
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
and
sent
them
to
did
not
wish
us
to
he
never
did
wish
us
to
go
he
would
get
quite
mad
if
i
wanted
so
much
as
to
join
a
but
this
time
i
was
set
on
and
i
would
for
what
right

said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
when
all
father's
friends
were
to
be
and
he
said
that
i
had
nothing
fit
to

had
my
purple
plush
that
i
had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
at
when
nothing
else
would
he
went
off
to
france
upon
the
business
of
the
but
we
mother
and
with
who
used
to
be
our
and
it
was
there
i
met
said
when
came
back
from
france
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
he
was
very
good
about
he
i
and
shrugged
his
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to
a
for
she
would
have
her
then
at
the
ball
you
as
i
a
gentleman
called
i
met
him
that
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
and
after
that
we
met
is
to
i
met
him
twice
for
but
after
that
father
came
back
and
angel
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
you
know
father
didn't
like
anything
of
the
he
wouldn't
have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
and
he
used
to
say
that
a
woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
but
as
i
used
to
say
to
a
woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
and
i
had
not
got
mine
how
about
did
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
father
was
going
off
to
france
again
in
a
and
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
we
could
write
in
the
and
he
used
to
write
every
i
took
the
letters
in
in
the
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
we
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
a
cashier
in
an
office
in
the
worst
of
i
don't
did
he
slept
on
the
you
don't
know
his
that
it
was
did
you
address
your
the
street
post
to
be
left
till
called
he
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from
a
so
i
offered
to
typewrite
like
he
did
but
he
wouldn't
have
for
he
said
that
when
i
wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
that
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
was
most
said
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
can
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
was
a
very
shy
he
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
very
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
even
his
voice
was
he'd
had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
he
told
and
it
had
left
him
with
a
weak
and
a
whispering
fashion
of
he
was
always
well
very
neat
and
but
his
eyes
were
just
as
mine
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
and
what
happened
when
your
returned
to
angel
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
he
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
with
my
hands
on
the
that
whatever
happened
i
would
always
be
true
to
mother
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
and
that
it
was
a
sign
of
his
mother
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than
i
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
i
began
to
ask
about
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
but
just
to
tell
him
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
i
didn't
quite
like
it
seemed
funny
that
i
should
ask
his
as
he
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
but
i
didn't
want
to
do
anything
on
the
so
i
wrote
to
father
at
where
the
company
has
its
french
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
missed
for
he
had
started
to
england
just
before
it
that
was
your
wedding
was
for
the
was
it
to
be
in
but
very
it
was
to
be
at
near
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
came
for
us
in
a
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into
a
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
we
got
to
the
church
and
when
the
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
but
he
never
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
the
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
that
was
last
and
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
said
he
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
whatever
i
was
to
be
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
i
was
always
to
remember
that
i
was
pledged
to
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
it
seemed
strange
talk
for
a
but
what
has
happened
since
gives
a
meaning
to
certainly
it
your
own
opinion
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
i
believe
that
he
foresaw
some
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
and
then
i
think
that
what
he
foresaw
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
more
how
did
your
mother
take
the
was
and
said
that
i
was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
your
did
you
tell
and
he
seemed
to
with
that
something
had
and
that
i
should
hear
of
as
he
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
and
then
leaving
if
he
had
borrowed
my
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
there
might
be
some
but
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at
a
shilling
of
and
what
could
have
and
why
could
he
not
it
drives
me
to
think
of
and
i
can't
sleep
a
wink
at
she
pulled
a
little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
shall
glance
into
the
case
for
said
i
have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
let
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
above
try
to
let
angel
vanish
from
your
as
he
has
done
from
your
you
don't
think
i'll
see
him
fear
what
has
happened
to
will
leave
that
question
in
my
i
should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
advertised
for
him
in
last
saturday's
said
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
and
your
lyon
angel's
address
you
never
i
where
is
your
father's
place
of
travels
for
the
great
claret
importers
of
you
have
made
your
statement
very
you
will
leave
the
papers
and
remember
the
advice
which
i
have
given
let
the
whole
incident
be
a
sealed
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
are
very
but
i
cannot
do
i
shall
be
true
to
he
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
for
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
she
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
with
a
promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
then
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
which
was
to
him
as
a
having
lit
he
leaned
back
in
his
with
the
thick
blue
spinning
up
from
and
a
look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
an
interesting
that
he
found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
by
the
is
rather
a
trite
you
will
find
parallel
if
you
consult
my
in
andover
in
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
the
hague
last
old
as
is
the
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
but
the
maiden
herself
was
most
appeared
to
read
a
good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
i
invisible
but
you
did
not
know
where
to
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
i
can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
the
suggestiveness
of
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from
a
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman's
describe
she
had
a
straw
with
a
feather
of
a
her
jacket
was
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
and
a
fringe
of
little
black
jet
her
dress
was
rather
darker
than
coffee
with
a
little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
her
gloves
were
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
her
boots
i
didn't
she
had
small
hanging
gold
and
a
general
air
of
being
fairly
in
a
sherlock
holmes
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
my
you
are
coming
along
you
have
really
done
very
well
it
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
and
you
have
a
quick
eye
for
never
trust
to
general
my
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
my
first
glance
is
always
at
a
woman's
in
a
man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
as
you
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
which
is
a
most
useful
material
for
showing
the
double
line
a
little
above
the
where
the
presses
against
the
was
beautifully
the
of
the
hand
leaves
a
similar
but
only
on
the
left
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
as
this
i
then
glanced
at
her
observing
the
dint
of
a
at
either
side
of
her
i
ventured
a
remark
upon
short
sight
and
which
seemed
to
surprise
surprised
it
was
i
was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
they
were
really
odd
the
one
having
a
slightly
decorated
and
the
other
a
plain
one
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
and
the
other
at
the
and
when
you
see
that
a
young
otherwise
neatly
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in
a
what
i
keenly
as
i
always
by
my
friend's
incisive
in
that
she
had
written
a
note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
you
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
she
had
written
in
a
hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
it
must
have
been
this
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
all
this
is
though
rather
but
i
must
go
back
to
would
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
i
held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
it
the
morning
of
the
a
gentleman
named
about
five
seven
in
strongly
sallow
black
a
little
bald
in
the
black
and
tinted
slight
infirmity
of
was
when
last
in
black
faced
with
black
gold
albert
and
grey
harris
tweed
with
brown
gaiters
over
known
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
anybody
will
said
to
the
he
glancing
over
are
very
absolutely
no
clue
in
them
to
save
that
he
quotes
balzac
there
is
one
remarkable
which
will
no
doubt
strike
are
i
only
but
the
signature
is
look
at
the
neat
little
at
the
there
is
a
you
but
no
superscription
except
which
is
rather
the
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive
we
may
call
it
dear
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
cannot
say
that
i
do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
that
was
not
the
i
shall
write
two
which
should
settle
the
one
is
to
a
firm
in
the
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady's
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six
o'clock
tomorrow
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
and
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
i
had
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend's
subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that
i
felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
once
only
had
i
known
him
to
in
the
case
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
of
the
irene
adler
but
when
i
looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
sign
of
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
study
in
i
felt
that
it
would
be
a
strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
i
left
him
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
with
the
conviction
that
when
i
came
again
on
the
next
evening
i
would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
miss
mary
a
professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
and
the
whole
of
next
day
i
was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
it
was
not
until
close
upon
six
o'clock
that
i
found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into
a
hansom
and
drive
to
baker
half
afraid
that
i
might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
of
the
little
i
found
sherlock
holmes
half
with
his
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
a
formidable
array
of
bottles
and
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
have
you
solved
i
asked
as
i
it
was
the
bisulphate
of
the
i
i
thought
of
the
salt
that
i
have
been
working
there
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
as
i
said
some
of
the
details
are
of
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
i
that
can
touch
the
was
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
miss
the
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
and
holmes
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
when
we
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and
a
tap
at
the
is
the
girl's
james
said
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
come
the
man
who
entered
was
a
some
thirty
years
of
and
with
a
insinuating
and
a
pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
he
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
each
of
placed
his
shiny
upon
the
and
with
a
slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
james
said
think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
a
little
but
i
am
not
quite
my
own
you
i
am
sorry
that
miss
sutherland
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
for
i
think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
it
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
but
she
is
a
very
impulsive
as
you
may
have
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on
a
of
i
did
not
mind
you
so
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
a
family
misfortune
like
this
noised
it
is
a
useless
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
the
said
holmes
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
i
will
succeed
in
discovering
gave
a
violent
start
and
dropped
his
am
delighted
to
hear
he
is
a
curious
remarked
a
typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as
a
man's
unless
they
are
quite
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
some
letters
get
more
worn
than
and
some
wear
only
on
one
you
remark
in
this
note
of
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the
and
a
slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the
there
are
fourteen
other
but
those
are
the
more
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
little
our
visitor
glancing
keenly
at
holmes
with
his
bright
little
now
i
will
show
you
what
is
really
a
very
interesting
holmes
think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
it
is
a
subject
to
which
i
have
devoted
some
little
i
have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
they
are
all
in
each
not
only
are
the
and
the
but
you
will
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which
i
have
alluded
are
there
as
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
cannot
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
he
you
can
catch
the
catch
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
said
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
let
you
that
i
have
caught
shouted
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like
a
rat
in
a
it
won't
it
said
holmes
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it
is
quite
too
and
it
was
a
very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple
a
that's
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
it
our
visitor
collapsed
into
a
with
a
ghastly
face
and
a
glitter
of
moisture
on
his
not
he
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
but
between
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless
a
trick
in
a
petty
way
as
ever
came
before
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
and
you
will
contradict
me
if
i
go
the
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
like
one
who
is
utterly

stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in

rather
to
as
it
than
to

married
a
woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
said
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
it
was
a
considerable
for
people
in
their
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made
a
serious
it
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
the
daughter
was
of
a
amiable
but
affectionate
and
in
her
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
and
her
little
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
now
her
marriage
would
of
the
loss
of
a
hundred
a
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
he
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
but
soon
he
found
that
that
would
not
answer
she
became
insisted
upon
her
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to
a
certain
what
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
he
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
with
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
masked
the
face
with
a
moustache
and
a
pair
of
bushy
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl's
short
he
appears
as
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
was
only
a
joke
at
groaned
our
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
likely
however
that
may
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
she
was
flattered
by
the
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
then
angel
began
to
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if
a
real
effect
were
to
be
there
were
and
an
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl's
affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
but
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
these
pretended
journeys
to
france
were
rather
the
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such
a
dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave
a
permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady's
mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
hence
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon
a
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to
a
possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
james
wished
miss
sutherland
to
be
so
bound
to
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
that
for
ten
years
to
at
any
she
would
not
listen
to
another
as
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
and
as
he
could
go
no
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of
a
and
out
at
the
i
think
that
was
the
chain
of
our
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
holmes
had
been
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with
a
cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
may
be
or
it
may
said
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
and
not
i
have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
law
as
you
touch
said
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
there
never
was
a
man
who
deserved
punishment
if
the
young
lady
has
a
brother
or
a
he
ought
to
lay
a
whip
across
your
by
he
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man's
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
but
here's
a
hunting
crop
and
i
think
i
shall
just
treat
myself
he
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was
a
wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
the
heavy
hall
door
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
james
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
a
said
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
and
ends
on
a
the
case
in
some
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
cannot
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
i
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
angel
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
as
far
as
we
could
was
the
then
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
was
so
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
which
both
hinted
at
a
as
did
the
bushy
my
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
of
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
you
see
all
these
isolated
together
with
many
minor
all
pointed
in
the
same
how
did
you
verify
once
spotted
my
it
was
easy
to
get
i
knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
having
taken
the
printed
i
eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of
a
the
the
and
i
sent
it
to
the
with
a
request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
i
had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
and
i
wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
as
i
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
the
same
post
brought
me
a
letter
from
of
to
say
that
the
description
tallied
in
every
respect
with
that
of
their
james
miss
i
tell
her
she
will
not
believe
you
may
remember
the
old
persian
is
danger
for
him
who
taketh
the
tiger
and
danger
also
for
whoso
snatches
a
delusion
from
a
there
is
as
much
sense
in
hafiz
as
in
and
as
much
knowledge
of
the
adventure
the
valley
mystery
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
one
my
wife
and
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
it
was
from
sherlock
holmes
and
ran
in
this
you
a
couple
of
days
to
have
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of
england
in
connection
with
valley
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
with
air
and
scenery
leave
by
the
do
you
said
my
looking
across
at
you
really
don't
know
what
to
i
have
a
fairly
long
list
at
would
do
your
work
for
you
have
been
looking
a
little
pale
i
think
that
the
change
would
do
you
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
sherlock
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
were
seeing
what
i
gained
through
one
of
i
if
i
am
to
i
must
pack
at
for
i
have
only
half
an
my
experience
of
camp
life
in
afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
prompt
and
ready
my
wants
were
few
and
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated
i
was
in
a
cab
with
my
rattling
away
to
sherlock
holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
his
gaunt
figure
made
even
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
and
cloth
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
said
makes
a
considerable
difference
to
having
someone
with
me
on
whom
i
can
thoroughly
local
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
if
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats
i
shall
get
the
we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
holmes
had
brought
with
among
these
he
rummaged
and
with
intervals
of
and
of
until
we
were
past
then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into
a
gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
you
heard
anything
of
the
he
a
i
have
not
seen
a
paper
for
some
london
press
has
not
had
very
full
i
have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
it
from
what
i
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
sounds
a
little
it
is
profoundly
singularity
is
almost
invariably
a
the
more
featureless
and
commonplace
a
crime
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
in
this
they
have
established
a
very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
is
a
it
is
conjectured
to
be
i
shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until
i
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
i
will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
understand
in
a
very
few
valley
is
a
country
district
not
very
far
from
in
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is
a
john
who
made
his
money
in
australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
one
of
the
farms
which
he
that
of
was
let
to
charles
who
was
also
an
the
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
turner
was
apparently
the
richer
so
mccarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
it
upon
terms
of
perfect
as
they
were
frequently
mccarthy
had
one
a
lad
of
and
turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
they
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
english
families
and
to
have
led
retired
though
both
the
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
of
the
mccarthy
kept
two
man
and
a
turner
had
a
considerable
some
at
the
that
is
as
much
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
now
for
the
june
that
on
monday
mccarthy
left
his
house
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
which
is
a
small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
he
had
been
out
with
his
in
the
morning
at
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
from
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
to
the
pool
is
a
quarter
of
a
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
one
was
an
old
whose
name
is
not
and
the
other
was
william
a
in
the
employ
of
both
these
witnesses
depose
that
mccarthy
was
walking
the
adds
that
within
a
few
minutes
of
his
seeing
mccarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
james
going
the
same
way
with
a
gun
under
his
to
the
best
of
his
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
and
the
son
was
following
he
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
two
were
seen
after
the
time
when
william
the
lost
sight
of
the
pool
is
thickly
wooded
with
just
a
fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
a
girl
of
patience
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
of
the
valley
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
she
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
mccarthy
and
his
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having
a
violent
she
heard
mccarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
she
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
quarrelling
near
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
she
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
mccarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
he
was
much
without
either
his
gun
or
his
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
on
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
the
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
the
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
of
his
son's
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within
a
few
paces
of
the
under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
and
a
verdict
of
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
he
was
on
wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
could
hardly
imagine
a
more
damning
i
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to
a
criminal
it
does
so
evidence
is
a
very
tricky
answered
holmes
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view
a
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
it
must
be
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
there
are
several
people
in
the
and
among
them
miss
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
who
believe
in
his
and
who
have
retained
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
study
in
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
being
rather
has
referred
the
case
to
and
hence
it
is
that
two
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
am
said
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
he
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
that
i
am
boasting
when
i
say
that
i
shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
or
even
of
to
take
the
first
example
to
i
very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
and
yet
i
question
whether
would
have
noted
even
so
a
thing
as
on
dear
i
know
you
i
know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you
shave
every
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
i
could
not
imagine
a
man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such
a
i
only
quote
this
as
a
trivial
example
of
observation
and
therein
lies
my
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
there
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
and
which
are
worth
are
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
but
after
the
return
to
on
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was
a
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
this
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
was
a
i
for
it
was
followed
by
a
protestation
of
on
the
top
of
such
a
damning
series
of
it
was
at
least
a
most
suspicious
the
said
is
the
brightest
rift
which
i
can
at
present
see
in
the
however
innocent
he
might
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
or
feigned
indignation
at
i
should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to
a
scheming
his
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
or
else
as
a
man
of
considerable
and
as
to
his
remark
about
his
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
and
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
the
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of
a
healthy
mind
rather
than
of
a
guilty
i
shook
my
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
i
they
and
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
is
the
young
man's
own
account
of
the
i
am
not
very
encouraging
to
his
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
you
will
find
it
and
may
read
it
for
he
picked
out
from
his
bundle
a
copy
of
the
local
herefordshire
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
i
settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
it
ran
in
this
james
the
only
son
of
the
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
the
my
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
and
i
was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
ross
with
john
the
shortly
after
my
return
i
heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
looking
out
of
my
i
saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
though
i
was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
i
then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
on
my
way
i
saw
william
the
as
he
had
stated
in
his
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
i
was
following
my
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
when
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pool
i
heard
a
cry
of
which
was
a
usual
signal
between
my
father
and
i
then
hurried
and
found
him
standing
by
the
he
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what
i
was
doing
a
conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
for
my
father
was
a
man
of
a
very
violent
seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
i
left
him
and
returned
towards
i
had
not
gone
more
than
when
i
heard
a
hideous
outcry
behind
which
caused
me
to
run
back
i
found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
with
his
head
terribly
i
dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
but
he
almost
instantly
i
knelt
beside
him
for
some
and
then
made
my
way
to
his
house
being
the
to
ask
for
i
saw
no
one
near
my
father
when
i
and
i
have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
he
was
not
a
popular
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
but
he
as
far
as
i
no
active
i
know
nothing
further
of
the
did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
he
mumbled
a
few
but
i
could
only
catch
some
allusion
to
a
what
did
you
understand
by
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
i
thought
that
he
was
what
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
i
should
prefer
not
to
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
press
it
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
i
can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
that
is
for
the
court
to
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
i
must
still
i
understand
that
the
cry
of
was
a
common
signal
between
you
and
your
it
how
was
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
considerable
i
do
not
did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
nothing
what
do
you
i
was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as
i
rushed
out
into
the
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
yet
i
have
a
vague
impression
that
as
i
ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
a
coat
of
some
or
a
plaid
when
i
rose
from
my
father
i
looked
round
for
but
it
was
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
it
was
cannot
say
what
it
i
had
a
feeling
something
was
far
from
the
dozen
yards
or
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
the
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within
a
dozen
yards
of
but
with
my
back
towards
concluded
the
examination
of
the
said
i
as
i
glanced
down
the
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
he
calls
and
with
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father's
dying
they
are
as
he
very
much
against
the
holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
said
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man's
don't
you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
too
if
he
could
not
invent
a
cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
too
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
as
a
dying
reference
to
a
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
i
shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
and
now
here
is
my
pocket
and
not
another
word
shall
i
say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
we
lunch
at
and
i
see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
it
was
nearly
four
o'clock
when
we
at
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
stroud
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
of
a
furtive
and
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the

spite
of
the
light
brown

which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic

had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
of
scotland
with
him
we
drove
to
the
hereford
arms
where
a
room
had
already
been
engaged
for

ordered
a

we
sat
over
a
cup

a
of
cigarettes
here
which
need

the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that
i
shall
use
the
carriage
laughed
no
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the

case
is
as
plain
as
a
and
the
more
one
goes
into

the
plainer
it
of
one
can't
refuse
a
and
such
a
very
positive
she
has
heard
of
and
would
have
your
though

repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which
i
had
not
already
bless
my

is
her
carriage
at
the
he
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
her
violet
eyes
her
lips
a
pink
flush
upon
her
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
sherlock
she
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
and
with
a
woman's
quick
fastening
upon
my
am
so
glad
that
you
have
i
have
driven
down
to
tell
you
i
know
that
james
didn't
do
i
know
and
i
want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
we
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
and
i
know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
but
he
is
too
to
hurt
a
such
a
charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
hope
we
may
clear
miss
said
sherlock
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that
i
you
have
read
the
you
have
formed
some
do
you
not
see
some
some
do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
think
that
it
is
very
she
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
he
gives
me
shrugged
his
am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been
a
little
quick
in
forming
his
he
he
is
i
know
that
he
is
james
never
did
and
about
his
quarrel
with
his
i
am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because
i
was
concerned
in
what
asked
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
james
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
mccarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be
a
marriage
between
james
and
i
have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
so
there
were
and
i
am
was
one
of
your
asked
he
in
favour
of
such
a
he
was
averse
to
it
no
one
but
mccarthy
was
in
favour
of
a
quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
holmes
shot
one
of
his
questioning
glances
at
you
for
this
said
i
see
your
father
if
i
call
am
afraid
the
doctor
won't
allow
have
you
not
poor
father
has
never
been
strong
for
years
but
this
has
broken
him
down
he
has
taken
to
his
and
willows
says
that
he
is
a
wreck
and
that
his
nervous
system
is
mccarthy
was
the
only
man
alive
who
had
known
dad
in
the
old
days
in
in
that
is
at
the
at
the
as
i
turner
made
his
miss
you
have
been
of
material
assistance
to
will
tell
me
if
you
have
any
news
no
doubt
you
will
go
to
the
prison
to
see
if
you
do
tell
him
that
i
know
him
to
be
miss
must
go
home
for
dad
is
very
and
he
misses
me
so
if
i
leave
and
god
help
you
in
your
she
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
am
ashamed
of
said
with
dignity
after
a
few
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
i
am
not
of
but
i
call
it
think
that
i
see
my
way
to
clearing
james
said
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
but
only
for
you
and
i
shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
we
have
still
time
to
take
a
train
to
hereford
and
see
him
let
us
do
i
fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
but
i
shall
only
be
away
a
couple
of
i
walked
down
to
the
station
with
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
finally
returning
to
the
where
i
lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
a
the
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
and
i
found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
that
i
at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to
a
consideration
of
the
events
of
the
supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man's
story
were
absolutely
then
what
hellish
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
and
the
moment
drawn
back
by
his
he
rushed
into
the
it
was
something
terrible
and
what
could
it
might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
i
rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
which
contained
a
verbatim
account
of
the
in
the
surgeon's
deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by
a
heavy
blow
from
a
blunt
i
marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
clearly
such
a
blow
must
have
been
struck
from
that
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
it
did
not
go
for
very
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
attention
to
then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to
a
what
could
that
it
could
not
be
a
man
dying
from
a
sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
but
what
could
it
i
cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
and
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
if
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
presumably
his
in
his
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not
a
dozen
paces
what
a
tissue
of
mysteries
and
the
whole
thing
i
did
not
wonder
at
and
yet
i
had
so
much
faith
in
sherlock
insight
that
i
could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
mccarthy's
it
was
late
before
sherlock
holmes
he
came
back
for
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
glass
still
keeps
very
he
remarked
as
he
sat
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
on
the
other
a
man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
and
i
did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
by
a
long
i
have
seen
young
what
did
you
learn
from
he
throw
no
at
i
was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
but
i
am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
he
is
not
a
very
though
comely
to
look
at
i
should
sound
at
cannot
admire
his
i
it
is
indeed
a
fact
that
he
was
averse
to
a
marriage
with
so
charming
a
young
lady
as
this
miss
thereby
hangs
a
rather
painful
this
fellow
is
in
love
with
but
some
two
years
when
he
was
only
a
and
before
he
really
knew
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at
a
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of
a
barmaid
in
bristol
and
marry
her
at
a
registry
no
one
knows
a
word
of
the
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
it
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
at
their
last
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
miss
on
the
other
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
and
his
who
was
by
all
accounts
a
very
hard
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
it
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
mark
that
it
is
of
good
has
come
out
of
for
the
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has
a
husband
already
in
the
bermuda
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
i
think
that
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
mccarthy
for
all
that
he
has
if
he
is
who
has
done
i
would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
one
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
for
his
son
was
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
the
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
those
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
and
now
let
us
talk
about
george
if
you
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
there
was
no
as
holmes
had
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
at
nine
o'clock
called
for
us
with
the
and
we
set
off
for
farm
and
the
is
serious
news
this
is
said
that
of
the
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
elderly
i
said
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
this
business
has
had
a
very
bad
effect
upon
he
was
an
old
friend
of
i
may
a
great
benefactor
to
for
i
have
learned
that
he
gave
him
farm
rent
that
is
said
in
a
hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
everybody
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
does
it
not
strike
you
as
a
little
singular
that
this
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
who
heiress
to
the
and
that
in
such
a
very
cocksure
as
if
it
were
merely
a
case
of
a
proposal
and
all
else
would
it
is
the
more
since
we
know
that
turner
himself
was
averse
to
the
the
daughter
told
us
as
do
you
not
deduce
something
from
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
said
winking
at
find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
are
said
holmes
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
i
have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
replied
with
some
that
mccarthy
senior
met
his
death
from
mccarthy
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine
is
a
brighter
thing
than
said
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
farm
upon
the
that
is
it
was
a
with
great
yellow
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
gave
it
a
stricken
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
we
called
at
the
when
the
at
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
and
also
a
pair
of
the
though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
having
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
holmes
desired
to
be
led
to
the
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
sherlock
holmes
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such
a
scent
as
men
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
baker
street
would
have
failed
to
recognise
his
face
flushed
and
his
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with
a
steely
his
face
was
bent
his
shoulders
his
lips
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
sinewy
his
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with
a
purely
animal
lust
for
the
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that
a
question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
at
the
only
provoked
a
impatient
snarl
in
swiftly
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
it
was
marshy
as
is
all
that
and
there
were
marks
of
many
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
sometimes
holmes
would
hurry
sometimes
stop
and
once
he
made
quite
a
little
detour
into
the
and
i
walked
behind
the
detective
indifferent
and
while
i
watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards
a
definite
the
which
is
a
little
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
farm
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
above
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner's
on
the
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
and
there
was
a
narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
so
moist
was
the
that
i
could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
to
as
i
could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
he
ran
like
a
dog
who
is
picking
up
a
and
then
turned
upon
my
did
you
go
into
the
pool
he
fished
about
with
a
i
thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
but
how
on
i
have
no
that
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
a
mole
could
trace
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had
i
been
here
before
they
came
like
a
herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
here
is
where
the
party
with
the
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
but
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
he
drew
out
a
lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have
a
better
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
are
young
mccarthy's
twice
he
was
and
once
he
ran
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
that
bears
out
his
he
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
then
here
are
the
father's
feet
as
he
paced
up
and
what
is
it
is
the
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
and
what
have
we
quite
unusual
they
they
they
come
course
that
was
for
the
now
where
did
they
come
he
ran
up
and
sometimes
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of
a
great
the
largest
tree
in
the
holmes
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with
a
little
cry
of
for
a
long
time
he
remained
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
a
jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
then
he
followed
a
pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
where
all
traces
were
has
been
a
case
of
considerable
he
returning
to
his
natural
fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
i
think
that
i
will
go
in
and
have
a
word
with
and
perhaps
write
a
little
having
done
we
may
drive
back
to
our
you
may
walk
to
the
and
i
shall
be
with
you
it
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
holmes
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
may
interest

holding

done
with

growing

only
lain
there

several

but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in

all
very
but
we
have
to
deal
with
a
british

i

work
i
shall
be
busy
this
and
shall
probably
return
to
london
by
the
evening

your

who

would
not
be

to
find
this

not
such
a
populous
shrugged
his
am
a
practical
he
i
really
cannot
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for
a
gentleman
with
a

i
should
become
the
of
scotland
said
holmes
have
given
you
the
here
are
your
i
shall
drop
you
a
line
before
i
having
left
at
his
we
drove
to
our
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
holmes
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with
a
pained
expression
upon
his
as
one
who
finds
himself
in
a
perplexing
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for
a
i
don't
know
quite
what
to
and
i
should
value
your
light
a
cigar
and
let
me
do
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
mccarthy's
narrative
which
struck
us
both
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
one
was
the
fact
that
his
father
according
to
his
cry
before
seeing
the
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to
a
he
mumbled
several
you
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son's
now
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
of
this
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
the
as
far
as
he
was
in
it
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
the
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
but
is
a
distinctly
australian
and
one
which
is
used
between
there
is
a
strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
mccarthy
expected
to
meet
him
at
pool
was
someone
who
had
been
in
of
the
sherlock
holmes
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
is
a
map
of
the
colony
of
he
wired
to
bristol
for
it
last
he
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
do
you
i
he
raised
his
that
was
the
word
the
man
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
he
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
so
and
of
is
i
is
and
you
i
had
narrowed
the
field
down
the
possession
of
a
grey
garment
was
a
third
point
granting
the
son's
statement
to
be
was
a
we
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
australian
from
ballarat
with
a
grey
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
where
strangers
could
hardly
comes
our
expedition
of
by
an
examination
of
the
ground
i
gained
the
trifling
details
which
i
gave
to
that
imbecile
as
to
the
personality
of
the
how
did
you
gain
know
my
it
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
height
i
know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
his
might
be
told
from
their
they
were
peculiar
his
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
he
put
less
weight
upon
because
he
was
his
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
the
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by
a
he
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
he
had
even
smoked
i
found
the
ash
of
a
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
indian
i
as
you
devoted
some
attention
to
and
written
a
little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
different
varieties
of
and
cigarette
having
found
the
i
then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it
was
an
indian
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
the
could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
therefore
he
used
a
the
tip
had
been
cut
not
bitten
but
the
cut
was
not
a
clean
so
i
deduced
a
blunt
i
have
drawn
a
net
round
this
man
from
which
he
cannot
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
i
see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
the
culprit
john
cried
the
hotel
opening
the
door
of
our
and
ushering
in
a
the
man
who
entered
was
a
strange
and
impressive
his
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
and
yet
his
craggy
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
his
tangled
grizzled
and
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with
a
shade
of
it
was
clear
to
me
at
a
glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
sit
down
on
the
said
holmes
had
my
the
brought
it
you
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
thought
people
would
talk
if
i
went
to
the
why
did
you
wish
to
see
he
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
as
though
his
question
was
already
said
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
is
i
know
all
about
the
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
help
he
i
would
not
have

roof
than
in
a
holmes
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
a
bundle
of
paper

so
it
matters
little
to
but
i
should
wish
to
spare
alice
the
and
now
i
will
make
the
thing
clear
to
it
has
been
a
long
time
in
the
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
didn't
know
this
dead
he
was
a
devil
i
tell
you
god
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such
a
man
as
his
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
and
he
has
blasted
my
i'll
tell
you
first
how
i
came
to
be
in
his
was
in
the
early
at
the
i
was
a
young
chap
and
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
i
got
among
bad
took
to
had
no
luck
with
my
took
to
the
and
in
a
word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here
a
highway
there
were
six
of
and
we
had
a
free
life
of
sticking
up
a
station
from
time
to
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
black
jack
of
ballarat
was
the
name
i
went
and
our
party
is
still
remembered
in
the
colony
as
the
ballarat
day
a
gold
convoy
came
down
from
ballarat
to
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
there
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
so
it
was
a
close
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
three
of
our
boys
were
before
we
got
the
i
put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
who
was
this
very
man
i
wish
to
the
lord
that
i
had
shot
him
but
i
spared
though
i
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
as
though
to
remember
every
we
got
away
with
the
became
wealthy
and
made
our
way
over
to
england
without
being
there
i
parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to
a
quiet
and
respectable
i
bought
this
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
and
i
set
myself
to
do
a
little
good
with
my
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which
i
had
earned
i
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
even
when
she
was
just
a
baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
in
a
i
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
all
was
going
well
when
mccarthy
laid
his
grip
upon
had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
and
i
met
him
in
regent
street
with
hardly
a
coat
to
his
back
or
a
boot
to
his
we
says
touching
me
on
the
be
as
good
as
a
family
to
there's
two
of
me
and
my
and
you
can
have
the
keeping
of
if
you
a
country
is
and
there's
always
a
policeman
within
down
they
came
to
the
west
there
was
no
shaking
them
and
there
they
have
lived
rent
free
on
my
best
land
ever
there
was
no
rest
for
no
no
turn
where
i
there
was
his
grinning
face
at
my
it
grew
worse
as
alice
grew
for
he
soon
saw
i
was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
whatever
he
wanted
he
must
and
whatever
it
was
i
gave
him
without
until
at
last
he
asked
a
thing
which
i
could
not
he
asked
for
you
had
grown
and
so
had
my
and
as
i
was
known
to
be
in
weak
it
seemed
a
fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
but
there
i
was
i
would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
not
that
i
had
any
dislike
to
the
but
his
blood
was
in
and
that
was
i
stood
mccarthy
i
braved
him
to
do
his
we
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
i
went
down
there
i
found
him
talking
with
his
so
i
smoked
a
cigar
and
waited
behind
a
tree
until
he
should
be
but
as
i
listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
he
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were
a
slut
from
off
the
it
drove
me
mad
to
think
that
i
and
all
that
i
held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
man
as
could
i
not
snap
the
i
was
already
a
dying
and
a
desperate
though
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
i
knew
that
my
own
fate
was
but
my
memory
and
my
both
could
be
saved
if
i
could
but
silence
that
foul
i
did
i
would
do
it
deeply
as
i
have
i
have
led
a
life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
but
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than
i
could
i
struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
his
cry
brought
back
his
but
i
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
though
i
was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which
i
had
dropped
in
my

the
true
of
all

it
is
not

me
to
judge

holmes
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn

that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such
a
pray

what
do
you
intend
to
view
of
your

are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at
a
higher
court

will
keep

if
mccarthy

condemned

shall
be

giant
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
help
said
holmes
after
a
long
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
helpless
i
never
hear
of
such
a
case
as
this
that
i
do
not
think
of
baxter's
and
but
for
the
grace
of
goes
sherlock
james
mccarthy
was
acquitted
at
the
assizes
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
holmes
and
submitted
to
the
defending
old
turner

for
seven
months
after
our

is
now

there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
adventure
the
five
orange
when
i
glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
sherlock
holmes
cases
between
the
years
and
i
am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
and
others
have
not
offered
a
field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high
a
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
have
baffled
his
analytical
and
would
as
beginnings
without
an
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
there
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that
i
am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
and
probably
never
will
entirely
cleared
the
year
furnished
us
with
a
long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
of
which
i
retain
the
among
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months
i
find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
of
the
amateur
mendicant
who
held
a
luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of
a
furniture
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
british
barque
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
in
the
island
of
and
finally
of
the
camberwell
poisoning
in
the
as
may
be
sherlock
holmes
was
by
winding
up
the
dead
man's
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
all
these
i
may
sketch
out
at
some
future
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which
i
have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
it
was
in
the
latter
days
of
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
all
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
london
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
like
untamed
beasts
in
a
as
evening
drew
the
storm
grew
higher
and
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like
a
child

the
sherlock

moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
his
records

at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
clark
fine
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
and
the
splash
of
the
rain

lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
my
wife
was
on
a
visit
to
her
and
for
a
few
days
i
was

dweller

more

my
old
quarters

nothing
less
would
bring
a
man
out
on
such
a
day
and
at
such
an
but
i
take
it
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
some
crony
of
the
sherlock

was
wrong
in
his
for
there
came
a
step
in
the
passage
and
a
tapping
at
the
he
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself
and
towards
the
vacant
chair
upon
which
a
newcomer
must
said

man
who
entered

some
at
the
and
trimly
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy

his

streaming
umbrella

he
held
in
his
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had

looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
and
i
could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
like
those
of
a
man
who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
owe
you
an

raising
his
golden
to
his
trust

the
young
man
pulled
his
chair
up
and
pushed
his
wet
feet
out
towards
the
said
john
but
my
own
affairs
as
far
as
i
can
little
to
do
with
this
awful
it
is
a
hereditary
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
i
must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
uncle
elias
and
my
father
my
father
had
a
small
factory
at
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
he
was
a
patentee
of
the
unbreakable
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon
a
handsome
uncle
elias
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
became
a
planter
in
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
at
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
and
afterwards
under
where
he
rose
to
be
a
when
lee
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
about
or
he
came
back
to
europe
and
took
a
small
estate
in
near
he
had
made
a
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
and
his
dislike
of
the
republican
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
he
was
a
singular
fierce
and
very
when
he
was
and
of
a
most
retiring
during
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
i
doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
he
had
a
garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
and
there
he
would
take
his
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
not
even
his
own
didn't
mind
in
he
took
a
fancy
to
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first
i
was
a
youngster
of
twelve
or
this
would
be
in
the
year
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
he
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
when
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
so
that
by
the
time
that
i
was
sixteen
i
was
quite
master
of
the
i
kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where
i
liked
and
do
what
i
so
long
as
i
did
not
disturb
him
in
his
there
was
one
singular
for
he
had
a
single
a
up
among
the
which
was
invariably
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
with
a
boy's
curiosity
i
have
peeped
through
the
but
i
was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such
a
collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such
a
was
in
letter
with
a
foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel's
it
was
not
a
common
thing
for
him
to
receive
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
said
he
as
he
took
it
what
can
this
opening
it
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
which
pattered
down
upon
his
i
began
to
laugh
at
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
his
lip
had
his
eyes
were
his
skin
the
colour
of
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
he
and
my
my
sins
have
overtaken
is
i
said
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
leaving
me
palpitating
with
i
took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
just
above
the
the
letter
three
times
there
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
what
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
i
left
the
and
as
i
ascended
the
stair
i
met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
in
one
and
a
small
brass
like
a
in
the
may
do
what
they
but
i'll
checkmate
them
said
he
with
an
mary
that
i
shall
want
a
fire
in
my
room
and
send
down
to
the
did
as
he
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived
i
was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
the
fire
was
burning
and
in
the
grate
there
was
a
mass
of
fluffy
as
of
burned
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
as
i
glanced
at
the
box
i
with
a
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble
which
i
had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
wish
said
my
witness
my
i
leave
my
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
to
my
your
whence
it
no
descend
to
if
you
can
enjoy
it
in
well
and
if
you
find
you
take
my
my
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
such
a
but
i
can't
say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
kindly
sign
the
paper
where
fordham
shows
signed
the
paper
as
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
the
singular
incident
as
you
may
the
deepest
impression
upon
and
i
pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
yet
i
could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
i
could
see
a
change
in
my
he
drank
more
than
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
most
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in
a
sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with
a
revolver
in
his
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
like
a
sheep
in
a
by
man
or
when
these
hot
fits
were
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
like
a
man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
at
such
times
i
have
seen
his
even
on
a
cold
glisten
with
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from
a
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
and
not
to
abuse
your
there
came
a
night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
we
found
when
we
went
to
search
for
face
downward
in
a
little
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
there
was
no
sign
of
any
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
so
that
the
having
regard
to
his
known
brought
in
a
verdict
of
but
who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
the
matter
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
and
of
some
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
holmes
statement
i
one
of
the
most
remarkable
to
which
i
have
ever
let
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your
uncle
of
the
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
letter
arrived
on
march
his
death
was
seven
weeks
upon
the
night
of
may
pray
my
father
took
over
the
at
my
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
which
had
been
always
locked
we
found
the
brass
box
although
its
contents
had
been
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
was
a
paper
with
the
initials
of
repeated
upon
and
and
a
written
we
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
colonel
for
the
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save
a
great
many
scattered
papers
and
bearing
upon
my
uncle's
life
in
some
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of
a
brave
others
were
of
a
date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
southern
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
for
he
had
evidently
taken
a
strong
part
in
opposing
the
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
it
was
the
beginning
of
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
january
of
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year
i
heard
my
father
give
a
sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
there
he
sitting
with
a
newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
he
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
story
about
the
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
what
on
earth
does
this
he
heart
had
turned
to
is
said
looked
inside
the
it
he
are
the
very
but
what
is
this
written
above
the
papers
on
the
i
peeping
over
his
what
he
sundial
in
the
there
is
no
said
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
said
gripping
hard
at
his
are
in
a
civilised
land
and
we
can't
have
tomfoolery
of
this
where
does
the
thing
come
i
glancing
at
the
preposterous
practical
said
have
i
to
do
with
sundials
and
i
shall
take
no
notice
of
such
should
certainly
speak
to
the
i
be
laughed
at
for
my
nothing
of
the
let
me
do
i
forbid
i
won't
have
a
fuss
made
about
such
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
for
he
was
a
very
obstinate
i
went
with
a
heart
which
was
full
of
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
major
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
i
was
glad
that
he
should
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
in
i
was
in
upon
the
second
day
of
his
absence
i
received
a
telegram
from
the
imploring
me
to
come
at
my
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
which
abound
in
the
and
was
lying
with
a
shattered
i
hurried
to
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
he
as
it
been
returning
from
fareham
in
the
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
and
the
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in
a
verdict
of
from
accidental
carefully
as
i
examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
i
was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
there
were
no
signs
of
no
no
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
and
yet
i
need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
and
that
i
was
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
this
sinister
way
i
came
into
my
you
will
ask
me
why
i
did
not
dispose
of
i
because
i
was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle's
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
was
in
that
my
poor
father
met
his
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
during
that
time
i
have
lived
happily
at
and
i
had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
i
had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
the
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat
a
crumpled
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
is
the
he
postmark
is
within
are
the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father's
last
and
then
the
papers
on
the
have
you
asked
tell
the
sank
his
face
into
his
white
have
felt
i
have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
i
seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
inexorable
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
cried
sherlock
must
or
you
are
nothing
but
energy
can
save
this
is
no
time
for
have
seen
the
they
listened
to
my
story
with
a
i
am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
as
the
jury
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
holmes
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
he
allowed
me
a
who
may
remain
in
the
house

with
you
his
orders

to
stay

you
come
to

why
did
you
not
come
at
did
not
it
was
only
that
i
spoke
to
major
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
we
should
have
acted
before
you
have
no
further
i
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
is
one
said
john
he
rummaged
in
his
coat
drawing
out
a
piece
of
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
have
some
said
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers
i
observed
that
the
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
i
found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
fluttered
out
from
among
the
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
beyond
the
mention
of
i
do
not
see
that
it
helps
us
i
think
myself
that
it
is
a
page
from
some
private
the
writing
is
undoubtedly
my
holmes
moved
the
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from
a
it
was
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
hudson
same
old
set
the
on
and
john
of
mccauley
john
swain
visited
all
said
folding
up
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
our
now
you
must
on
no
account
lose
another
we
cannot
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
you
must
get
home
instantly
and
shall
i
is
but
one
thing
to
it
must
be
done
at
you
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
you
must
also
put
in
a
note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
you
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
having
done
you
must
at
once
put
the
box
out
upon
the
as
do
you
not
think
of
or
anything
of
the
at
i
think
that
we
may
gain
that
by
means
of
the
but
we
have
our
web
to
while
theirs
is
already
the
first
consideration
is
to
remove
the
pressing
danger
which
threatens
the
second
is
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
to
punish
the
guilty
thank
said
the
young
rising
and
pulling
on
his
have
given
me
fresh
life
and
i
shall
certainly
do
as
you
not
lose
an
above
take
care
of
yourself
in
the
for
i
do
not
think
that
there
can
be
a
doubt
that
you
are
threatened
by
a
very
real
and
imminent
how
do
you
go
train
from

not
yet
the
streets
will
be
so
i
trust
that
you
may
be
in
and
yet
you
cannot
guard
yourself
too
am

i
shall
set
to
work
upon
your

see
you
at
your
secret
lies
in
it

there
that
i
shall
seek
i
shall
call
upon
you
in
a
or
in
two
with
news
as
to
the
box

the
i
shall
take
your
advice

he
shook
hands
with
us
and
took
his
outside
the
wind
still
screamed
and
the
rain
splashed
and
pattered
against
the
this
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
in
upon
us
like
a
sheet
of
in
a
now
to
have
been
by
them
once
sherlock
holmes
sat
for
some
time
in
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
then
he
lit
his
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
he
remarked
at
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
the
sign
of
and
yet
this
john
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
have
i
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
he
what
are
who
is
this
and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
sherlock
holmes
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
with
his
ideal
he
when
he
had
once
been
shown
a
single
fact
in
all
its
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
as
cuvier
could
correctly
describe
a
whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of
a
single
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in
a
series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
both
before
and
we
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
problems
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought
a
solution
by
the
aid
of
their
to
carry
the
to
its
highest
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
and
this
in
itself
as
you
will
readily
a
possession
of
all
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
is
a
somewhat
rare
it
is
not
so
that
a
man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
and
this
i
have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
if
i
remember
you
on
one
in
the
early
days
of
our
defined
my
limits
in
a
very
precise
i
was
a
singular
and
politics
were
marked
at
i
botany
geology
profound
as
regards
the
from
any
region
within
fifty
miles
of
chemistry
anatomy
sensational
literature
and
crime
records
and
by
cocaine
and
i
were
the
main
points
of
my
holmes
grinned
at
the
last
he
say
as
i
said
that
a
man
should
keep
his
little
stocked
with
all
the
furniture
that
he
is
likely
to
and
the
rest
he
can
put
away
in
the
of
his
where
he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
for
such
a
case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
kindly
hand
me
down
the
letter
of
the
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
thank
now
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
in
the
first
we
may
start
with
a
strong
presumption
that
colonel
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
men
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
florida
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
english
provincial
his
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
england
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
so
we
may
assume
as
a
working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
as
to
what
it
was
he
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
did
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
first
was
from
the
second
from
and
the
third
from
east
what
do
you
deduce
from
are
all
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
we
have
already
a
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
strong
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of
a
and
now
let
us
consider
another
in
the
case
of
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
in
dundee
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
does
that
suggest
greater
distance
to
the
letter
had
also
a
greater
distance
to
i
do
not
see
the
is
at
least
a
presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is
a
it
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
you
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
if
they
had
come
from
pondicherry
in
a
steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
as
a
matter
of
seven
weeks
i
think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
is
than
it
is
and
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
and
why
i
urged
young
to
the
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
but
this
one
comes
from
and
therefore
we
cannot
count
upon
i
can
it
this
relentless
papers
which
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
a
single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
a
there
must
have
been
several
in
and
they
must
have
been
men
of
resource
and
their
papers
they
mean
to
be
the
holder
of
them
who
it
in
this
way
you
see
ceases
to
be
the
initials
of
an
individual
and
becomes
the
badge
of
a
of
what
you
said
sherlock
bending
forward
and
sinking

you
never
heard
of
the
klux
never

of

said

klux
a
name
derived
from
the
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sound
produced
by
cocking
a
this
terrible
secret
society
was
formed
by
some
soldiers
in
the
southern
states
after
the
civil
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
notably
in
the
and
its
power
was
used
for
political
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the
negro
voters
and
the
murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
its
its
outrages
were
usually
preceded
by
a
warning
sent
to
the
marked
man
in
some
fantastic
but
generally
recognised
sprig
of
in
some
melon
seeds
or
orange
in
on
receiving
this
the
victim
might
either
openly
abjure
his
former
or
might
fly
from
the
if
he
braved
the
matter
death
would
unfailingly
come
upon
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
so
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
and
so
systematic
its
that
there
is
hardly
a
case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
for
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
in
the
year
the
movement
rather
suddenly
although
there
have
been
sporadic
outbreaks
of
the
same
sort
since
that
will
said
laying
down
the
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
from
america
with
their
it
may
well
have
been
cause
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
you
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
the
page
we
have
such
as
we
might
it
if
i
remember
the
to
and
sent
the
society's
warning
to
then
there
are
successive
entries
that
a
and
or
left
the
and
finally
that
was
i
a
sinister
result
for
i
that
we
may
let
some
light
into
this
dark
and
i
believe
that
the
only
chance
young
has
in
the
meantime
is
to
do
what
i
have
told
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
to
be
done
so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
it
had
cleared
in
the
and
the
sun
was
shining
with
a
subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
sherlock
holmes
was
already
at
breakfast
when
i
came
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
said
i
a
very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
steps
will
you
i
will
very
much
depend
upon
the
results
of
my
first
i
may
have
to
go
down
to
after
will
not
go
there
i
shall
commence
with
the
just
ring
the
bell
and
the
maid
will
bring
up
your
as
i
i
lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it
rested
upon
a
heading
which
sent
a
chill
to
my
i
are
too
said
laying
down
his
feared
as
how
was
it
he
spoke
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
deeply
eye
caught
the
name
of
and
the
heading
near
waterloo
here
is
the
nine
and
ten
last
night
of
the
on
duty
near
waterloo
heard
a
cry
for
help
and
a
splash
in
the
the
was
extremely
dark
and
so
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect
a
the
was
by
the
aid
of
the
the
body
was
eventually
it
proved
to
be
that
of
a
young
gentleman
whose
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
was
john
and
whose
residence
is
near
it
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
waterloo
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
for
river
the
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
we
sat
in
silence
for
some
holmes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than
i
had
ever
seen

said
at
is
a
petty
no
but
it
hurts
my
it
becomes
a
personal
matter
with
me
if
god
sends
me
i
shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
that
he
should
come
to
me
for
and
that
i
should
send
him
away
to
his
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
with
a
flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and
a
nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin

exclaimed
at

was
nearly
ten
o'clock
before
he

pale
and
he
walked
up
to
the
and
tearing
a
piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
washing
it
down
with
a
long
draught
of

had
escaped

took
an
orange
from
the

tearing
it
to
pieces

squeezed

of
these

took
five
and
thrust
them
into

inside

sealed

shall
have

he
did
you
trace

took
a
large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
all
covered
with
dates
and
have
spent
the
whole
said
registers
and
files
of
the
old
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
pondicherry
in
january
and
february
in
there
were
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
of
the

attracted
my
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared

that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
i
was
not
and
am
not
sure
but
i
knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
american
searched
the
dundee
and
when
i
found
that
the
barque
was
there
in
my
suspicion
became
a

then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
had
arrived
here
last
i
went
down
to
the
albert
dock
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
homeward
bound
to
i
wired
to
gravesend
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
and
not
very
far
from
the
isle
of
will
you
i
have
my
hand
upon
he
and
the
two
are
as
i
the
only
americans
in
the
the
others
are
finns
and
i
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship
last
i
had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
by
the
time
that
their
reaches
savannah
the
will
have
carried
this
and
the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
savannah
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon
a
charge
of
there
is
ever
a
in
the
best
laid
of
human
and
the
murderers
of
john
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
which
would
show
them
that
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
was
upon
their
very
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
we
waited
long
for
news
of
the
of
but
none
ever
reached
we
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
atlantic
a
shattered
of
a
boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of
a
with
the
letters
carved
upon
and
that
is
all
which
we
shall
ever
know
of
the
fate
of
the
adventure
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
brother
of
the
late
elias
principal
of
the
theological
college
of
was
much
addicted
to
the
habit
grew
upon
as
i
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
for
having
read
de
description
of
his
dreams
and
he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with
laudanum
in
an
attempt
to
produce
the
same
he
as
so
many
more
have
that
the
practice
is
easier
to
attain
than
to
get
rid
and
for
many
years
he
continued
to
be
a
slave
to
the
an
object
of
mingled
horror
and
pity
to
his
friends
and
i
can
see
him
with
pasty
drooping
and
all
huddled
in
a
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
a
noble
one
was
in
came
a
ring
to
my
about
the
hour
when
a
man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
i
sat
up
in
my
and
my
wife
laid
her
down
in
her
lap
and
made
a
little
face
of
said
have
to
go
i
for
i
was
newly
come
back
from
a
weary
we
heard
the
door
a
few
hurried
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
our
own
door
flew
and
a
clad
in
some
with
a
black
entered
the
will
excuse
my
calling
so
she
and
suddenly
losing
her
she
ran
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife's
and
sobbed
upon
her
i'm
in
such
she
do
so
want
a
little
said
my
pulling
up
her
is
kate
how
you
startled
i
had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
didn't
know
what
to
so
i
came
straight
to
that
was
always
the
folk
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to
a
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
you
must
have
some
wine
and
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
or
should
you
rather
that
i
sent
james
off
to
i
want
the
doctor's
advice
and
it's
about
he
has
not
been
home
for
two
i
am
so
frightened
about
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband's
to
me
as
a
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
we
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
did
she
know
where
her
husband
was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
it
seems
that
it
she
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
when
the
fit
was
on
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
hitherto
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
and
he
had
come
twitching
and
in
the
but
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
and
he
lay
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
there
he
was
to
be
she
was
sure
of
at
the
bar
of
in
upper
but
what
was
she
to
how
could
a
young
and
timid
make
her
way
into
such
a
place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
there
was
the
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
might
i
not
escort
her
to
this
and
as
a
second
why
should
she
come
at
i
was
medical
and
as
such
i
had
influence
over
i
could
manage
it
better
if
i
were
i
promised
her
on
my
word
that
i
would
send
him
home
in
a
cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
and
so
in
ten
minutes
i
had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
behind
and
was
speeding
eastward
in
a
hansom
on
a
strange
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
upper
lane
is
a
vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
london
between
a
and
a
approached
by
a
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
a
black
gap
like
the
mouth
of
a
i
found
the
den
of
which
i
was
in
ordering
my
cab
to
i
passed
down
the
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
and
by
the
light
of
a
flickering
above
the
door
i
found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into
a
low
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
and
terraced
with
wooden
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
through
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch
a
glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
bowed
bent
heads
thrown
and
chins
pointing
with
here
and
there
a
eye
turned
upon
the
out
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
now
now
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
the
most
lay
but
some
muttered
to
and
others
talked
together
in
a
monotonous
their
conversation
coming
in
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
at
the
farther
end
was
a
small
brazier
of
burning
beside
which
on
a
wooden
stool
there
sat
a
thin
old
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
and
his
elbows
upon
his
staring
into
the
as
i
a
sallow
malay
attendant
had
hurried
up
with
a
pipe
for
me
and
a
supply
of
the
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
i
have
not
come
to
said
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
wish
to
speak
with
there
was
a
movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
and
peering
through
the
i
saw
and
staring
out
at
it's
said
he
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
with
every
nerve
in
a
what
o'clock
is
what
june
i
thought
it
was
it
is
what
want
to
frighten
a
chap
he
sank
his
face
onto
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
in
a
high
treble
tell
you
that
it
is
your
wife
has
been
waiting
this
two
days
for
you
should
be
ashamed
of
i
but

got

few
three

go

one
i
shall
go
in
but
i
must
owe
find
what
i
i
am
all
off
i
can
do
nothing
for
i
walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
stupefying
fumes
of
the
and
looking
about
for
the
as
i
passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier
i
felt
a
sudden
pluck
at
my
and
a
low
voice
past
and
then
look
back
at
the
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
i
glanced
they
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
very
very
bent
with
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
i
took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
it
took
all
my
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into
a
cry
of
he
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but
his
form
had
filled
his
wrinkles
were
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
and
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
was
none
other
than
sherlock
he
made
a
slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
and
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
subsided
into
a
i
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
low
as
you
he
have
excellent
if
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours
i
should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have
a
little
talk
with
have
a
cab
pray
send
him
home
in
you
may
safely
trust
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
i
should
recommend
you
also
to
send
a
note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
if
you
will
wait
i
shall
be
with
you
in
five
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
sherlock
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
and
put
forward
with
such
a
quiet
air
of
i
that
when
whitney
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
and
for
the
i
could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
written
my
paid
led
him
out
to
the
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
in
a
very
short
time
a
decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
and
i
was
walking
down
the
street
with
sherlock
for
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with
a
bent
back
and
an
uncertain
glancing
quickly
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into
a
hearty
fit
of
said
you
imagine
that
i
have
added
to
cocaine
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
was
certainly
surprised
to
find
you
not
more
so
than
i
to
find
came
to
find
a
i
to
find
an
one
of
my
natural
shall
i
my
natural
i
am
in
the
midst
of
a
very
remarkable
and
i
have
hoped
to
find
a
clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
as
i
have
done
before
had
i
been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth
an
hour's
for
i
have
used
it
before
now
for
my
own
and
the
rascally
lascar
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
there
is
a
at
the
back
of
that
near
the
corner
of
paul's
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
you
do
not
mean
we
should
be
rich
men
if
we
had
pounds
for
every
poor
devil
who
has
been
done
to
death
in
that
it
is
the
vilest
on
the
whole
and
i
fear
that
neville
has
entered
it
never
to
leave
it
but
our
trap
should
be
he
put
his
two
forefingers
between
his
teeth
and
whistled
signal
which
was
answered
by
a
similar
whistle
from
the
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
said
as
a
tall
dashed
up
through
the
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels
of
yellow
light
from
its
side
come
with
won't
i
can
be
of
a
trusty
comrade
is
always
of
and
a
chronicler
still
more
my
room
at
the
is
a
that
is
i
am
staying
there
while
i
conduct
the
is
in
we
have
a
drive
before
i
am
all
in
the
course
you
you'll
know
all
about
it
jump
up
all
we
shall
not
need
here's
half
a
look
out
for
me
about
give
her
her
so
he
flicked
the
horse
with
his
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
which
widened
until
we
were
flying
across
a
broad
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
beyond
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
regular
footfall
of
the
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
a
dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
and
a
star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
of
the
holmes
drove
in
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
lost
in
while
i
sat
beside
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
we
had
driven
several
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
when
he
shook
shrugged
his
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
have
a
grand
gift
of
said
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as
a
my
it
is
a
great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
i
was
wondering
what
i
should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
when
she
meets
me
at
the
forget
that
i
know
nothing
about
shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
it
seems
absurdly
and
somehow
i
can
get
nothing
to
go
there's
plenty
of
no
but
i
can't
get
the
end
of
it
into
my
i'll
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
and
maybe
you
can
see
a
spark
where
all
is
dark
to
years
be
in
came
to
lee
a
neville
by
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
he
took
a
large
laid
out
the
grounds
very
and
lived
generally
in
good
by
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
and
in
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
local
by
whom
he
now
has
two
he
had
no
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as
a
rule
in
the
returning
by
the
from
cannon
street
every
is
now
years
of
is
a
man
of
temperate
a
good
a
very
affectionate
and
a
man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
i
may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
amount
to
pounds
while
he
has
pounds
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
capital
and
counties
there
is
no
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
monday
neville
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home
a
box
of
by
the
merest
his
wife
received
a
telegram
upon
this
same
very
shortly
after
his
to
the
effect
that
a
small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
aberdeen
shipping
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
fresno
which
branches
out
of
upper
where
you
found
me
had
her
started
for
the
did
some
proceeded
to
the
company's
got
her
and
found
herself
at
exactly
walking
through
lane
on
her
way
back
to
the
have
you
followed
me
so
is
very
you
monday
was
an
exceedingly
hot
and
walked
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing
a
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
while
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
as
it
seemed
to
beckoning
to
her
from
a
the
window
was
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
he
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
one
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
that
something
was
amiss
with
she
rushed
down
the
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
at
the
foot
of
the
she
met
this
lascar
scoundrel
of
whom
i
have
who
thrust
her
back
aided
by
a
who
acts
as
assistant
pushed
her
out
into
the
filled
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
she
rushed
down
the
lane
by
rare
met
in
fresno
street
a
number
of
constables
with
an
all
on
their
way
to
their
the
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
had
last
been
there
was
no
sign
of
him
in
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save
a
crippled
wretch
of
hideous
it
made
his
home
both
he
and
the
lascar
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
so
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
had
been
deluded
with
a
she
sprang
at
a
small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
out
there
fell
a
cascade
of
children's
it
was
the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
the
rooms
were
carefully
and
results
all
pointed
to
an
abominable
the
front
room
was
plainly
furnished
as
a
and
led
into
a
small
which
looked
out
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
between
the
wharf
and
the
bedroom
window
is
a
narrow
which
is
dry
at
low
tide
but
is
covered
at
high
tide
with
at
least
four
and
a
half
feet
of
the
bedroom
window
was
a
broad
one
and
opened
from
on
examination
traces
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
and
several
scattered
drops
were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
thrust
away
behind
a
curtain
in
the
front
room
were
all
the
clothes
of
neville
with
the
exception
of
his
his
his
his
and
his
were
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
upon
any
of
these
and
there
were
no
other
traces
of
neville
out
of
the
window
he
must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little
promise
that
he
could
save
himself
by
for
the
tide
was
at
its
very
highest
at
the
moment
of
the
now
as
to
the
villains
who
seemed
to
be
immediately
implicated
in
the
the
lascar
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
the
vilest
but
by
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within
a
very
few
seconds
of
her
husband's
appearance
at
the
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
his
defence
was
one
of
absolute
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
hugh
his
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
much
for
the
lascar
now
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the
opium
and
who
was
certainly
the
last
human
being
whose
eyes
rested
upon
neville
his
name
is
hugh
and
his
hideous
face
is
one
which
is
familiar
to
every
man
who
goes
much
to
the
he
is
a
professional
though
in
order
to
avoid
the
police
regulations
he
pretends
to
a
small
trade
in
wax
some
little
distance
down
threadneedle
upon
the
there
as
you
may
have
a
small
angle
in
the
here
it
is
that
this
creature
takes
his
daily
with
his
tiny
stock
of
matches
on
his
and
as
he
is
a
piteous
spectacle
a
small
rain
of
charity
descends
into
the
greasy
leather
cap
which
lies
upon
the
pavement
beside
i
have
watched
the
fellow
more
than
once
before
ever
i
thought
of
making
his
professional
and
i
have
been
surprised
at
the
harvest
which
he
has
reaped
in
a
short
his
you
is
so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
a
shock
of
orange
a
pale
face
disfigured
by
a
horrible
by
its
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
a
bulldog
and
a
pair
of
very
penetrating
dark
which
present
a
singular
contrast
to
the
colour
of
his
all
mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd
of
mendicants
and
does
his
for
he
is
ever
ready
with
a
reply
to
any
piece
of
chaff
which
may
be
thrown
at
him
by
the
this
is
the
man
whom
we
now
learn
to
have
been
the
lodger
at
the
opium
and
to
have
been
the
last
man
to
see
the
gentleman
of
whom
we
are
in
a
said
could
he
have
done
against
a
man
in
the
prime
of

a
cripple
in
the
sense
that
he
walks
with
a
but
in
other
respects
he
appears
to
be
a
powerful
and
surely
your
medical
experience
would
tell
that
weakness
in
one
limb
is
often
compensated
for
by
exceptional
strength
in
the

fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
upon
the
and
she
was
escorted
home
in
a
cab
by
the
as
her
presence
could
be
of
no
help
to
them
in
their

who
had
charge
of
the
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
but
without
finding
anything
which
threw
any
light
upon
the
one
mistake
had
been
made
in
not
arresting
boone
as
he
was
allowed
some
few
minutes
during
which
he
might
have
communicated
with
his
friend
the
but
this
fault
was
soon
and
he
was
seized
and
without
anything
being
found
which
could
incriminate
there
it
is
some
upon
his
right
but
he
pointed
to
his
which
had
been
cut
near
the
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
adding
that
he
had
been
to
the
window
not
long
and
that
the
stains
which
had
been
observed
there
came
doubtless
from
the
same
he
denied
strenuously
having
ever
seen
neville
and
swore
that
the
presence
of
the
clothes
in
his
room
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
the
as
to
assertion
that
she
had
actually
seen
her
husband
at
the
he
declared
that
she
must
have
been
either
mad
or
he
was
loudly
to
the
while
the
inspector
remained
upon
the
premises
in
the
hope
that
the
ebbing
tide
might
afford
some
fresh
it
though
they
hardly
found
upon
the
what
they
had
feared
to
it
was
neville
and
not
neville
which
lay
uncovered
as
the
tide
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
in
the
cannot
i
don't
think
you
would
every
pocket
stuffed
with
pennies
and
pennies
and
it
was
no
wonder
that
it
had
not
been
swept
away
by
the
but
a
human
body
is
a
different
there
is
a
fierce
eddy
between
the
wharf
and
the
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
i
understand
that
all
the
other
clothes
were
found
in
the
would
the
body
be
dressed
in
a
coat
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
suppose
that
this
man
boone
had
thrust
neville
through
the
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
what
would
he
do
it
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
he
would
seize
the
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
he
has
little
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
lascar
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
there
is
not
an
instant
to
be
he
rushes
to
some
secret
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the
he
throws
it
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
certainly
sounds
we
will
take
it
as
a
working
hypothesis
for
want
of
a
as
i
have
told
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
but
it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
he
had
for
years
been
known
as
a
professional
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been
a
very
quiet
and
innocent
there
the
matter
stands
at
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
neville
was
doing
in
the
opium
what
happened
to
him
when
where
is
he
and
what
hugh
boone
had
to
do
with
his
all
as
far
from
a
solution
as
i
confess
that
i
cannot
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
while
sherlock
holmes
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
and
we
rattled
along
with
a
country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
just
as
he
we
drove
through
two
scattered
where
a
few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
are
on
the
outskirts
of
said
my
have
touched
on
three
english
counties
in
our
short
starting
in
passing
over
an
angle
of
and
ending
in
see
that
light
among
the
that
is
the
and
beside
that
lamp
sits
a
woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
i
have
little
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse's
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
baker
i
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but
a
welcome
for
my
friend
and
i
hate
to
meet
when
i
have
no
news
of
her
here
we
we
had
pulled
up
in
front
of
a
large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
a
had
run
out
to
the
horse's
and
springing
i
followed
holmes
up
the
winding
which
led
to
the
as
we
the
door
flew
and
a
little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
with
a
touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
she
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
one
hand
upon
the
one
in
her
her
body
slightly
her
head
and
face
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
a
standing
she
and
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
she
gave
a
cry
of
hope
which
sank
into
a
groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
good
god
for
but
come
you
must
be
for
you
have
had
a
long
is
my
he
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
and
a
lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with
this
am
delighted
to
see
said
pressing
my
hand
i
am
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
dear
said
am
an
old
and
if
i
were
not
i
can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
if
i
can
be
of
any
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
i
shall
be
indeed
sherlock
said
the
lady
as
we
entered
a
upon
the
table
of
which
a
cold
supper
had
been
laid
should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
to
which
i
beg
that
you
will
give
a
plain
not
trouble
about
my
i
am
not
nor
given
to
i
simply
wish
to
hear
your
real
what
your
heart
of
do
you
think
that
neville
is
sherlock
holmes
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
she
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in
a
i
do
think
that
he
is
don't
say
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that
i
have
received
a
letter
from
him
sherlock
holmes
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
he
she
stood
holding
up
a
little
slip
of
paper
in
the
i
see
he
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
i
had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
the
envelope
was
a
very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
gravesend
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
or
rather
of
the
day
for
it
was
considerably
after
murmured
this
is
not
your
husband's
but
the
enclosure
perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
can
you
tell
you
is
in
perfectly
black
which
has
dried
the
rest
is
of
the
which
shows
that
has
been
if
it
had
been
written
straight
and
then
none
would
be
of
a
deep
black
this
man
has
written
the
and
there
has
then
been
a
pause
before
he
wrote
the
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it
of
a
but
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
let
us
now
see
the
there
has
been
an
enclosure
there
was
a
his
you
are
sure
that
this
is
your
husband's
of
his
hand
when
he
wrote
it
is
very
unlike
his
usual
and
yet
i
know
it
do
not
be
all
will
come
there
is
a
huge
error
which
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
wait
in
written
in
pencil
upon
the
of
a
octavo
no
posted
in
gravesend
by
a
man
with
a
dirty
and
the
flap
has
been
if
i
am
not
very
much
in
by
a
person
who
had
been
chewing
and
you
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
husband's
neville
wrote
those
they
were
posted
at
the
clouds
though
i
should
not
venture
to
say
that
the
danger
is
he
must
be
this
is
a
clever
forgery
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
the
after
proves
it
may
have
been
taken
from
it
it
is
his
very
own
it
have
been
written
on
monday
and
only
posted
is
much
may
have
happened
you
must
not
discourage
i
know
that
all
is
well
with
there
is
so
keen
a
sympathy
between
us
that
i
should
know
if
evil
came
upon
on
the
very
day
that
i
saw
him
last
he
cut
himself
in
the
and
yet
i
in
the
rushed
upstairs
instantly
with
the
utmost
certainty
that
something
had
do
you
think
that
i
would
respond
to
such
a
trifle
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
his
have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
the
impression
of
a
woman
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion
of
an
analytical
and
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have
a
very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
but
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
why
should
he
remain
away
from
cannot
it
is
on
monday
he
made
no
remarks
before
leaving
you
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
much
the
window
he
might
have
called
to
as
i
gave
an
inarticulate
call
for
you
he
waved
his
it
might
have
been
a
cry
of
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
might
cause
him
to
throw
up
his
is
you
thought
he
was
pulled
disappeared
so
might
have
leaped
you
did
not
see
anyone
else
in
the
but
this
horrible
man
confessed
to
having
been
and
the
lascar
was
at
the
foot
of
the
your
as
far
as
you
could
had
his
ordinary
clothes
without
his
collar
or
i
distinctly
saw
his
bare
he
ever
spoken
of
he
ever
showed
any
signs
of
having
taken
those
are
the
principal
points
about
which
i
wished
to
be
absolutely
we
shall
now
have
a
little
supper
and
then
for
we
may
have
a
very
busy
day
a
large
and
comfortable
room
had
been
placed
at
our
and
i
was
quickly
between
the
for
i
was
weary
after
my
night
of
sherlock
holmes
was
a
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
would
go
for
and
even
for
a
without
turning
it
rearranging
his
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
it
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
he
took
off
his
coat
and
put
on
a
large
blue
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
with
these
he
constructed
a
sort
of
eastern
upon
which
he
perched
himself
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and
a
box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
i
saw
him
sitting
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
aquiline
so
he
sat
as
i
dropped
off
to
and
so
he
sat
when
a
sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
and
i
found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
the
pipe
was
still
between
his
the
smoke
still
curled
and
the
room
was
full
of
a
dense
tobacco
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which
i
had
seen
upon
the
previous
he
for
a
morning
no
one
is
stirring
but
i
know
where
the
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
he
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
his
eyes
and
he
seemed
a
different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
as
i
dressed
i
glanced
at
my
it
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
it
was
minutes
past
i
had
hardly
finished
when
holmes
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
want
to
test
a
little
theory
of
said
pulling
on
his
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
i
deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
charing
but
i
think
i
have
the
key
of
the
affair
where
is
i
the
he
i
am
not
he
seeing
my
look
of
have
just
been
and
i
have
taken
it
and
i
have
got
it
in
this
gladstone
come
my
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
we
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
in
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
with
the
waiting
at
the
we
both
sprang
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
london
a
few
country
carts
were
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in
a
has
been
in
some
points
a
singular
said
flicking
the
horse
on
into
a
confess
that
i
have
been
as
blind
as
a
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
in
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
surrey
passing
down
the
waterloo
bridge
road
we
crossed
over
the
and
dashing
up
wellington
street
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
bow
sherlock
holmes
was
well
known
to
the
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
one
of
them
held
the
horse's
head
while
the
other
led
us
is
on
asked
how
are
a
stout
official
had
come
down
the
in
a
peaked
cap
and
frogged
wish
to
have
a
quiet
word
with
step
into
my
room
it
was
a
with
a
huge
ledger
upon
the
and
a
telephone
projecting
from
the
the
inspector
sat
down
at
his
can

do
for
called
about
that
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
neville
of
he
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
i
you
have
him
the
he
he
gives
no
but
he
is
a
dirty
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
and
his
face
is
as
black
as
a
when
once
his
case
has
been
he
will
have
a
regular
prison
and
i
if
you
saw
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
should
like
to
see
him
very
that
is
easily
come
this
you
can
leave
your
i
think
that
i'll
take
come
this
if
you
he
led
us
down
a
opened
a
barred
passed
down
a
winding
and
brought
us
to
a
whitewashed
corridor
with
a
line
of
doors
on
each
third
on
the
right
is
said
the
it
he
quietly
shot
back
a
panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
is
said
can
see
him
very
we
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
the
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
in
a
very
deep
breathing
slowly
and
he
was
a
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
with
a
coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
he
as
the
inspector
had
extremely
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
a
broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in
a
perpetual
a
shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
a
isn't
said
the
certainly
needs
a
remarked

an
idea
that
he
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
he
opened
the
gladstone
bag
as
he
and
took
to
my
a
very
large
you
are
a
funny
chuckled
the
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
we
will
soon
make
him
cut
a
much
more
respectable
i
don't
know
why
said
the
doesn't
look
a
credit
to
the
bow
street
does
he
slipped
his
key
into
the
and
we
all
very
quietly
entered
the
the
sleeper
half
and
then
settled
down
once
more
into
a
deep
holmes
stooped
to
the
moistened

and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down

off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from
a
gone
was
the
coarse
brown
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
a
twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
and
sitting
up
in
his
was
a
and
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
then
suddenly
realising
the
he
broke
into
a
scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to

with
the
reckless

of
a
man
who
abandons
himself
to
his

said
pray
what

i
charged
making
away
with
neville
you
can't
be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make
a
case
of
attempted
suicide

said
the
inspector
with
a
i
have
been
years
in
the
but
this
really
takes
the
i
am
neville
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
and
i
am
illegally
but
a
very
great
error
has
been

have
done
better
to
have
trusted

sherlock

sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
you
leave
it
to
a
court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
said
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
on
the
other
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against

do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into

notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
the
case
would
then
never
go
into
court
at
bless
cried
the
prisoner
would
have
endured
even
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret
as
a
family
blot
to
my
are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard
my
my
father
was
a
schoolmaster
in
where
i
received
an
excellent
i
travelled
in
my
took
to
the
and
finally
became
a
reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
one
day
my
editor
wished
to
have
a
series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
and
i
volunteered
to
supply
there
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
it
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that
i
could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
when
an
actor
i
of
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
and
had
been
famous
in
the
for
my
i
took
advantage
now
of
my
i
painted
my
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible
i
made
a
good
scar
and
fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in
a
twist
by
the
aid
of
a
small
slip
of
then
with
a
red
head
of
and
an
appropriate
i
took
my
station
in
the
business
part
of
the
ostensibly
as
a
but
really
as
a
for
seven
hours
i
plied
my
and
when
i
returned
home
in
the
evening
i
found
to
my
surprise
that
i
had
received
no
less
than
wrote
my
articles
and
thought
little
more
of
the
matter
some
time
i
backed
a
bill
for
a
friend
and
had
a
writ
served
upon
me
for
i
was
at
my
wit's
end
where
to
get
the
but
a
sudden
idea
came
to
i
begged
a
grace
from
the
asked
for
a
holiday
from
my
and
spent
the
time
in
begging
in
the
city
under
my
in
ten
days
i
had
the
money
and
had
paid
the
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
settle
down
to
arduous
work
at
pounds
a
week
when
i
knew
that
i
could
earn
as
much
in
a
day
by
smearing
my
face
with
a
little
laying
my
cap
on
the
and
sitting
it
was
a
long
fight
between
my
pride
and
the
but
the
dollars
won
at
and
i
threw
up
reporting
and
sat
day
after
day
in
the
corner
which
i
had
first
inspiring
pity
by
my
ghastly
face
and
filling
my
pockets
with
only
one
man
knew
my
he
was
the
keeper
of
a
low
den
in
which
i
used
to
lodge
in
where
i
could
every
morning
emerge
as
a
squalid
beggar
and
in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into
a
man
about
this
a
was
well
paid
by
me
for
his
so
that
i
knew
that
my
secret
was
safe
in
his
very
soon
i
found
that
i
was
saving
considerable
sums
of
i
do
not
mean
that
any
beggar
in
the
streets
of
london
could
earn
pounds
a
is
less
than
my
average
i
had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
and
also
in
a
facility
of
which
improved
by
practice
and
made
me
quite
a
recognised
character
in
the
all
day
a
stream
of
varied
by
poured
in
upon
and
it
was
a
very
bad
day
in
which
i
failed
to
take
i
grew
richer
i
grew
more
took
a
house
in
the
and
eventually
without
anyone
having
a
suspicion
as
to
my
real
my
dear
wife
knew
that
i
had
business
in
the
she
little
knew
monday
i
had
finished
for
the
day
and
was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when
i
looked
out
of
my
window
and
to
my
horror
and
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
i
gave
a
cry
of
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
rushing
to
my
the
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
i
heard
her
voice
but
i
knew
that
she
could
not
swiftly
i
threw
off
my
pulled
on
those
of
a
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
even
a
wife's
eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete
a
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
in
the
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
i
threw
open
the
reopening
by
my
violence
a
small
cut
which
i
had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
then
i
seized
my
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which
i
had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which
i
carried
my
i
hurled
it
out
of
the
and
it
disappeared
into
the
the
other
clothes
would
have
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
rush
of
constables
up
the
and
a
few
minutes
after
i
i
to
my
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
neville
i
was
arrested
as
his
do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
i
was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
and
hence
my
preference
for
a
dirty
knowing
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
i
slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
lascar
at
a
moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
together
with
a
hurried
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
note
only
reached
her
said
what
a
week
she
must
have
police
have
watched
this
said
inspector
i
can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post
a
letter
probably
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
was
said
nodding
have
no
doubt
of
but
have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
but
what
was
a
fine
to
must
stop
said
the
police
are
to
hush
this
thing
there
must
be
no
more
of
hugh
have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
which
a
man
can
that
case
i
think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
but
if
you
are
found
then
all
must
come
i
am
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
i
wish
i
knew
how
you
reach
your
reached

said
my
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
i
that
if
we
drive
to
baker
street
we
shall
just
be
in
time
for
the
adventure
of
the
blue
carbuncle
i
had
called
upon
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
upon
the
second
morning
after
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
he
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in
a
purple
a
within
his
reach
upon
the
and
a
pile
of
crumpled
morning
evidently
newly
near
at

the
couch
was
a
wooden
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung
a
very
seedy
and
disreputable
much

worse
for
and
cracked
in
several

lens
and
a
forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair

that
the

had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
are
said
i
interrupt
at
i
am
glad
to
have
a
friend
with
whom
i
can
discuss
my
the
matter
is
a
perfectly
trivial
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
i
seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
for
a
sharp
frost
had
set
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice

homely
as
it

thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to

will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of

no

sherlock

of
those
whimsical
little
incidents

will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each

within
the
space
of
a
few
square
amid
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense
a
swarm
of
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
and
many
a
little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
we
have
already
had
experience
of
much
i
of
the
last
six
cases

i
have
added
to
my
three

been
entirely
free
of
any

recover
the
irene
adler
to
the
singular
case
of
miss
mary
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man

the
twisted

have
no

that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
you
know

to
him
that
this
trophy
is
his
he
found
its
owner
is
i
beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as
a
battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
as
to
how
it
came
it
arrived
upon
christmas

with
a
good
fat

i
have
no

o'clock

out
between

stranger
and

little
knot

off

also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered

most
unimpeachable
christmas

true

printed
upon

card

also
true

me
on
christmas

retained

took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it

a
very
ordinary
black
hat

exceedingly

there

smearing
them

me

it

it
up

at

introspective
fashion

perhaps
less

it
might

yet
there
are
a
few
inferences

a

a
strong
balance

that
the
man

highly
intellectual

of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
within
the
last
three
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
he
had
but
has
less
now
than
pointing
to
a
moral
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his

to
indicate
some
evil

at
work
upon

account

grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
and
which
he
anoints
with
these
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
by
the
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he

when
i

you
these

no

that
i

but
i

confess
that
i

unable

a
question
of
cubic

man
with
so
large
a
brain
must
have
something
in
decline
of
his
hat

three
years
these

at
the
edge
came
in
it
is
a
hat
of
the
very
best
look
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
if
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive
a
hat
three
years
and
has
had
no
hat
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
that
is
clear
but
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
sherlock
holmes
is
the
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the

never
sold
upon
if
this
man
ordered
it
is
a
sign
of
a
certain
amount
of
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the

since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
which
is
a
distinct
proof
of
a
weakening
on
the
other
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
them
with
which
is
a
sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
reasoning
is
certainly
further
that
he
is
that
his
hair
is
that
it
has
been
recently
and
that
he
uses
are

not

the

with

your

allows
you
to
go
out
in
such
a
i
shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
wife's

remember
the

an
answer
to
but
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
tallow
or
even
might
come
by
but
when
i
see
no
less
than
i
think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
guttering
candle
in
the
he
never
got
from
a

you
it
is
very
said
as
you
said
just
there
has
been
no
crime
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of
a
all
this
seems
to
be
rather
a
waste
of
sherlock
holmes
had
opened
his
mouth
to
when
the
door
flew
and
the
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of
a
man
who
is
dazed
with
the
he
what
of
has
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
holmes
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get
a
fairer
view
of
the
man's
excited
see
what
my
wife
found
in
its
he
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm
a
brilliantly
scintillating
blue
rather
smaller
than
a
bean
in
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
sherlock
holmes
sat
up
with
a
said
is
treasure
trove
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
have
a
precious
it
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
more
than
a
precious
it
is
the
precious
the
countess
of
blue
i
i
ought
to
know
its
size
and
seeing
that
i
have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
the
times
every
day
it
is
absolutely
and
its
value
can
only
be
but
the
reward
offered
of
pounds
is
certainly
not
within
a
twentieth
part
of
the
market
thousand
great
lord
of
the
commissionaire
plumped
down
into
a
chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
is
the
and
i
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
countess
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
was
if
i
remember
at
the
hotel
i
on
december
just
five
days
john
a
was
accused
of
having
abstracted
it
from
the
lady's
the
evidence
against
him
was
so
strong
that
the
case
has
been
referred
to
the
i
have
some
account
of
the
matter
i
he
rummaged
amid
his
glancing
over
the
until
at
last
he
smoothed
one
doubled
it
and
read
the
following
cosmopolitan
jewel
john
was
brought
up
upon
the
charge
of
having
upon
the
abstracted
from
the
of
the
countess
of
the
valuable
gem
known
as
the
blue
james
at
the
gave
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
shown
up
to
the
of
the
countess
of
upon
the
day
of
the
robbery
in
order
that
he
might
solder
the
second
bar
of
the
which
was
he
had
remained
with
some
little
but
had
finally
been
called
on
he
found
that
had
that
the
bureau
had
been
forced
and
that
the
small
morocco
casket
in
as
it
afterwards
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
was
lying
empty
upon
the
ryder
instantly
gave
the
and
was
arrested
the
same
but
the
stone
could
not
be
found
either
upon
his
person
or
in
his
catherine
maid
to
the
deposed
to
having
heard
cry
of
dismay
on
discovering
the
and
to
having
rushed
into
the
where
she
found
matters
as
described
by
the
last
inspector
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
who
struggled
and
protested
his
innocence
in
the
strongest
evidence
of
a
previous
conviction
for
robbery
having
been
given
against
the
the
magistrate
refused
to
deal
summarily
with
the
but
referred
it
to
the
who
had
shown
signs
of
intense
emotion
during
the
fainted
away
at
the
conclusion
and
was
carried
out
of
so
much
for
the
said
holmes
tossing
aside
the
question
for
us
now
to
solve
is
the
sequence
of
events
leading
from
a
rifled
at
one
end
to
the
crop
of
a
goose
in
court
road
at
the
you
our
little
deductions
have
suddenly
assumed
a
much
more
important
and
less
innocent
here
is
the
the
stone
came
from
the
and
the
goose
came
from
henry
the
gentleman
with
the
bad
hat
and
all
the
other
characteristics
with
which
i
have
bored
so
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this
gentleman
and
ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
to
do
we
must
try
the
simplest
means
and
these
lie
undoubtedly
in
an
advertisement
in
all
the
evening
if
this
i
shall
have
recourse
to
other
will
you
me
a
pencil
and
that
slip
of
at
the
corner
of
a
goose
and
a
black
felt
henry
baker
can
have
the
same
by
applying
at
this
evening
at
baker
that
is
clear
and
but
will
he
see
he
is
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
to
a
poor
the
loss
was
a
heavy
he
was
clearly
so
scared
by
his
mischance
in
breaking
the
window
and
by
the
approach
of
peterson
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
but
since
then
he
must
have
bitterly
regretted
the
impulse
which
caused
him
to
drop
his
the
introduction
of
his
name
will
cause
him
to
see
for
everyone
who
knows
him
will
direct
his
attention
to
here
you
run
down
to
the
advertising
agency
and
have
this
put
in
the
evening
in
the
pall
evening
and
any
others
that
occur
to
and
this
i
shall
keep
the
thank
i
just
buy
a
goose
on
your
way
back
and
leave
it
here
with
for
we
must
have
one
to
give
to
this
gentleman
in
place
of
the
one
which
your
family
is
now
when
the
commissionaire
had
holmes
took
up
the
stone
and
held
it
against
the
a
bonny
said
see
how
it
glints
and
of
course
it
is
a
nucleus
and
focus
of
every
good
stone
they
are
the
devil's
pet
in
the
larger
and
older
jewels
every
facet
may
stand
for
a
bloody
this
stone
is
not
yet
twenty
years
it
was
found
in
the
banks
of
the
amoy
river
in
southern
china
and
is
remarkable
in
having
every
characteristic
of
the
save
that
it
is
blue
in
shade
instead
of
ruby
in
spite
of
its
it
has
already
a
sinister
there
have
been
two
a
a
and
several
robberies
brought
about
for
the
sake
of
this
weight
of
crystallised
who
would
think
that
so
pretty
a
toy
would
be
a
purveyor
to
the
gallows
and
the
i'll
lock
it
up
in
my
strong
box
now
and
drop
a
line
to
the
countess
to
say
that
we
have
you
think
that
this
man
is
cannot
do
you
imagine
that
this
other
henry
had
anything
to
do
with
the
i
much
more
likely
that
henry
baker
is
an
absolutely
innocent
who
had
no
idea
that
the
bird
which
he
was
carrying
was
of
considerably
more
value
than
if
it
were
made
of
solid
i
shall
determine
by
a
very
simple
test
if
we
have
an
answer
to
our
you
can
do
nothing
until
that
case
i
shall
continue
my
professional
but
i
shall
come
back
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
you
have
for
i
should
like
to
see
the
solution
of
so
tangled
a
glad
to
see
i
dine
at
there
is
a
i
by
the
in
view
of
recent
perhaps
i
ought
to
ask
hudson
to
examine
its
i
had
been
delayed
at
a
and
it
was
a
little
after
six
when
i
found
myself
in
baker
street
once
as
i
approached
the
house
i
saw
a
tall
man
in
a
scotch
bonnet
with
a
coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
just
as
i
arrived
the
door
was
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
henry
i
said
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
take
this
chair
by
the
it
is
a
cold
and
i
observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
is
that
your
that
is
undoubtedly
my
he
was
a
large
man
with
rounded
a
massive
and
a
intelligent
sloping
down
to
a
pointed
beard
of
grizzled
a
touch
of
red
in
nose
and
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
extended
recalled
surmise
as
to
his
his
rusty
black
was
buttoned
right
up
in
with
the
collar
turned
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without
a
sign
of
cuff
or
he
spoke
in
a
slow
staccato
choosing
his
words
with
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of
a
man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
had
at
the
hands
of
have
retained
these
things
for
some
said
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
our
visitor
gave
a
rather
shamefaced
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
i
did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in
a
hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
by
the
about
the
we
were
compelled
to
eat
eat
our
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
but
i
presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
answered
baker
with
a
sigh
of
we
still
have
the
and
so
on
of
your
own
so
if
you
the
man
burst
into
a
hearty
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
said
beyond
that
i
can
hardly
see
what
use
the
of
my
late
acquaintance
are
going
to
be
to
i
think
with
your
i
will
confine
my
attentions
to
the
excellent
bird
which
i
perceive
upon
the
sherlock
holmes
glanced
sharply
across
at
me
with
a
slight
shrug
of
his
is
your
and
there
your
said
the
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me
where
you
got
the
other
one
i
am
somewhat
of
a
fowl
and
i
have
seldom
seen
a
better
grown
said
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his

a
few
of
us
who
frequent
the
alpha
near
the
are
to
be
found
in
the
museum
itself
during
the
you
this
year
our
good
by
instituted
a
goose
by
on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every
we
were
each
to
receive
a
bird
at
my
pence
were
duly
and
the
rest
is
familiar
to
i
am
much
indebted
to
for
a
scotch
bonnet

fitted
neither
to
my
years
nor
my

a
comical
pomposity
of
manner

bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
much
for
henry

holmes
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
is
quite
certain
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
are
you
i
suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into
a
supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
all
it
was
a
bitter
so
we
drew
on
our
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in
a
cloudless
and
the
breath
of
the
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
our
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
harley
and
so
through
street
into
oxford
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
bloomsbury
at
the
alpha
which
is
a
small
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
which
runs
down
into
holmes
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
beer
should
be
excellent
if
it
is
as
good
as
your
said
the
man
seemed
i
was
speaking
only
half
an
hour
ago
to
henry
who
was
a
member
of
your
goose
i
but
you
not
our
i
got
the
two
dozen
from
a
salesman
in
covent
i
know
some
of
which
was
is
his
i
don't
know
here's
your
good
health
and
prosperity
to
your
for
he
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
watson
that
though
we
have
so
homely
a
thing
as
a
goose
at
one
end
of
this
we
have
at
the
other
a
man
who
will
certainly
get
seven
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
it
is
possible
that
our
inquiry
may
but
confirm
his
in
any
we
have
a
line
of
investigation
which
has
been
missed
by
the
and
which
a
singular
chance
has
placed
in
our
let
us
follow
it
out
to
the
bitter
faces
to
the
and
quick
we
passed
across
down
and
so
through
a
zigzag
of
slums
to
covent
garden
one
of
the
largest
stalls
bore
the
name
of
upon
and
the
proprietor
a
with
a
sharp
face
and
trim
was
helping
a
boy
to
put
up
the
it's
a
cold
said
the
salesman
nodded
and
shot
a
questioning
glance
at
my
out
of
i
continued
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
you
have
five
hundred
no
there
are
some
on
the
stall
with
the
but
i
was
recommended
to
landlord
of
the
i
sent
him
a
couple
of
birds
they
now
where
did
you
get
them
to
my
surprise
the
question
provoked
a
burst
of
anger
from
the
said
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
are
you
driving
let's
have
it
is
straight
i
should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
i
shan't
tell
so
it
is
a
matter
of
no
but
i
don't
know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such
a
you'd
be
as
if
you
were
as
pestered
as
i
when
i
pay
good
money
for
a
good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
but
it's
are
the
and
did
you
sell
the
geese
and
will
you
take
for
the
one
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
i
have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
said
holmes
you
won't
tell
us
the
bet
is
that
is
but
i'm
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on
a
matter
of
and
i
have
a
fiver
on
it
that
the
bird
i
ate
is
country
you've
lost
your
for
it's
town
snapped
the
nothing
of
the
say
it
don't
believe
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than
who
have
handled
them
ever
since
i
was
a
i
tell
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
alpha
were
town
never
persuade
me
to
believe
you
merely
taking
your
for
i
know
that
i
am
but
i'll
have
a
sovereign
on
with
just
to
teach
you
not
to
be
the
salesman
chuckled
me
the
said
the
small
boy
brought
round
a
small
thin
volume
and
a
great
laying
them
out
together
beneath
the
hanging
said
the
thought
that
i
was
out
of
but
before
i
finish
you'll
find
that
there
is
still
one
left
in
my
you
see
this
little
the
list

you
to

sherlock
holmes
looked
deeply
he
drew
a
sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
turning
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
a
few
yards
off
he
stopped
under
a
and
laughed
in
the
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
you
see
a
man
with
whiskers
of
that
cut
and
the
protruding
out
of
his
you
can
always
draw
him
by
a
said
daresay
that
if
i
had
put
pounds
down
in
front
of
that
man
would
not
have
given
me
such
complete
information
as
was
drawn
from
him
by
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
me
on
a
we
i
nearing
the
end
of
our
and
the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
it
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
and
i
his
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
turning
round
we
saw
a
little
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
while
the
framed
in
the
door
of
his
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
had
enough
of
you
and
your
he
wish
you
were
all
at
the
devil
if
you
come
pestering
me
any
more
with
your
silly
talk
i'll
set
the
dog
at
you
bring
here
and
i'll
answer
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
did
i
buy
the
geese
off
but
one
of
them
was
mine
all
the
whined

me
to
ask

can
ask
the
king
of
for
all
i
i've
had
enough
of
get
out
of

rushed
fiercely
and
the
inquirer
flitted
away
into
the
this
may
save
us
a
visit
to
brixton
whispered
with
and
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
made
of
this
striding
through
the
scattered
knots
of
people
who
lounged
round
the
flaring
my
companion
speedily
overtook
the
little
man
and
touched
him
upon
the
he
sprang
and
i
could
see
in
the
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
been
driven
from
his
are
what
do

he
asked
in
a
quavering
will
excuse
said
holmes
i
could
not
help
overhearing
the
questions
which
you
put
to
the
salesman

i
think
that
i
could
be
of
assistance
to
who
are
how
could
you
know
anything

everything
of

endeavouring
to
trace
some
geese
which
were
sold
by

and
by
him
to
his
of
which
henry

the
very
man

have
longed
to

the
little
fellow
with
outstretched
hands
and
quivering
can
hardly
explain
to
you
how
interested
i
am
in
this
sherlock
holmes
hailed
a
which
was
that
case
we
had
better
discuss
it
in
a
cosy
room
rather
than
in
this
said
pray
tell
before
we
go
who
it
is
that
i
have
the
pleasure
of
the
man
hesitated
for
an
name

john
he
answered
with
a
sidelong
the
real
said
holmes
is
always
awkward
doing
business
with
an
a
flush
sprang
to
the
white
cheeks
of
the
said

james

attendant
at
the
hotel
pray
step
into
the
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
tell
you
everything
which
you
would
wish
to
the
little
man
stood
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
as
one
who
is
not
sure
whether
he
is
on
the
verge
of
a
windfall
or
of
a
then
he
stepped
into
the
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
back
in
the
at
baker
nothing
had
been
said
during
our
but
the
thin
breathing
of
our
new
and
the
and
of
his
spoke
of
the
nervous
tension
within
we
said
holmes
cheerily
as
we
filed
into
the
fire
looks
very
seasonable
in
this
you
look
pray
take
the
i
will
just
put
on
my
slippers
before
we
settle
this
little
matter
of
you
want
to
know
what
became
of
those
i
of
that
it
was
one
i
imagine
in
which
you
were
with
a
black
bar
across
the
ryder
quivered
with
he
you
tell
me
where
it
went
came
and
a
most
remarkable
bird
it
i
don't
wonder
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
it
laid
an
egg
after
it
was
brightest
little
blue
egg
that
ever
was
i
have
it
here
in
my
our
visitor
staggered
to
his
feet
and
clutched
the
mantelpiece
with
his
right
holmes
unlocked
his
and
held
up
the
blue
which
shone
out
like
a
with
a
ryder
stood
glaring
with
a
drawn
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown
said
holmes
or
you'll
be
into
the
give
him
an
arm
back
into
his
he's
not
got
blood
enough
to
go
in
for
felony
with
give
him
a
dash
of
now
he
looks
a
little
more
what
a
shrimp
it
to
be
for
a
moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
but
the
brandy
brought
a
tinge
of
colour
into
his
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
have
almost
every
link
in
my
and
all
the
proofs
which
i
could
possibly
so
there
is
little
which
you
need
tell
that
little
may
as
well
be
cleared
up
to
make
the
case
you
had
of
this
blue
stone
of
the
countess
of
was
catherine
who
told
me
of
said
he
in
a
crackling
the
temptation
of
sudden
wealth
so
easily
acquired
was
too
much
for
as
it
has
been
for
better
men
before
but
you
were
not
very
scrupulous
in
the
means
you
it
seems
to
that
there
is
the
making
of
a
very
pretty
villain
in
you
knew
that
this
man
the
had
been
concerned
in
some
such
matter
and
that
suspicion
would
rest
the
more
readily
upon
what
did
you
you
made
some
small
job
in
my
lady's
and
your
confederate
you
managed
that
he
should
be
the
man
sent
when
he
had
you
rifled
the
raised
the
and
had
this
unfortunate
man
you
ryder
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the
rug
and
clutched
at
my
companion's
god's
have
he
of
my
of
my
it
would
break
their
i
never
went
wrong
i
never
will
i
swear
i'll
swear
it
on
a
don't
bring
it
into
for
back
into
your
said
holmes
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
in
the
dock
for
a
crime
of
which
he
knew
will
i
will
leave
the
then
the
charge
against
him
will
break
we
will
talk
about
and
now
let
us
hear
a
true
account
of
the
next
how
came
the
stone
into
the
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
tell
us
the
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
ryder
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
said
had
been
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
for
i
did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
there
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
i
went
as
if
on
some
and
i
made
for
my
sister's
she
had
married
a
man
named
and
lived
in
brixton
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
all
the
way
there
every
man
i
met
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
policeman
or
a
for
all
that
it
was
a
cold
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before
i
came
to
the
brixton
my
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
and
why
i
was
so
but
i
told
her
that
i
had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
then
i
went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked
a
pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
had
a
friend
once
called
who
went
to
the
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
one
day
he
had
met
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
i
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
for
i
knew
one
or
two
things
about
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
where
he
and
take
him
into
my
he
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
but
how
to
get
to
him
in
i
thought
of
the
agonies
i
had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
i
might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
i
was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how
i
could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that
i
might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for
a
christmas
and
i
knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
i
would
take
my
goose
and
in
it
i
would
carry
my
stone
to
there
was
a
little
shed
in
the
and
behind
this
i
drove
one
of
the
fine
big
with
a
barred
i
caught
and
prying
its
bill
i
thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
the
bird
gave
a
and
i
felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
but
the
creature
flapped
and
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
as
i
turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
were
you
doing
with
that
says
said
said
you'd
give
me
one
for
and
i
was
feeling
which
was
the
says
set
yours
aside
for
we
call
it's
the
big
white
one
over
there's
of
which
makes
one
for
and
one
for
and
two
dozen
for
the
says
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
i'd
rather
have
that
one
i
was
handling
just
other
is
a
good
three
pound
said
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
i'll
have
the
and
i'll
take
it
said
just
as
you
said
a
little
is
it
you
white
one
with
the
barred
right
in
the
middle
of
the
very
kill
it
and
take
it
with
i
did
what
she
and
i
carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
i
told
my
pal
what
i
had
for
he
was
a
man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell
a
thing
like
that
he
laughed
until
he
and
we
got
a
knife
and
opened
the
my
heart
turned
to
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
and
i
knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
i
left
the
rushed
back
to
my
and
hurried
into
the
back
there
was
not
a
bird
to
be
seen
are
they
i
to
the
of
covent
was
there
another
with
a
barred
i
same
as
the
one
i
there
were
two
and
i
could
never
tell
them
of
course
i
saw
it
and
i
ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
you
heard
him
yourselves
he
has
always
answered
me
like
my
sister
thinks
that
i
am
going
sometimes
i
think
that
i
am
and
now
i
am
myself
a
branded
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which
i
sold
my
god
help
god
help
he
burst
into
convulsive
with
his
face
buried
in
his
there
was
a
long
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
sherlock
upon
the
edge
of
the
then
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
said
heaven
bless
more
get
and
no
more
words
were
there
was
a
a
clatter
upon
the
the
bang
of
a
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
said
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
if
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
and
the
case
must
i
suppose
that
i
am
commuting
a
but
it
is
just
possible
that
i
am
saving
a
this
fellow
will
not
go
wrong
he
is
too
terribly
send
him
to
gaol
and
you
make
him
a
for
it
is
the
season
of
chance
has
put
in
our
way
a
most
singular
and
whimsical
and
its
solution
is
its
own
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
we
will
begin
another
in
also
a
bird
will
be
the
chief
the
adventure
of
the
speckled
band
on
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which
i
have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
sherlock
i
find
many
some
a
large
number
merely
but
none
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
and
even
the
of
all
these
varied
i
cannot
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
surrey
family
of
the
of
stoke
the
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
baker
it
is
possible
that
i
might
have
placed
them
upon
record
but
a
promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
from
which
i
have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
for
i
have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
it
was
early
in
april
in
the
year
that
i
woke
one
morning
to
find
sherlock
holmes
fully
by
the
side
of
my
he
was
a
late
as
a
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only
a
i
blinked
up
at
him
in
some
and
perhaps
just
a
little
for
i
was
myself
regular
in
my
sorry
to
knock
you
said
it's
the
common
lot
this
hudson
has
been
knocked
she
retorted
upon
and
i
on
is
a
it
seems
that
a
young
lady
has
arrived
in
a
considerable
state
of
who
insists
upon
seeing
she
is
waiting
now
in
the
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
i
presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
should
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
you
i
am
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
i
at
any
that
i
should
call
you
and
give
you
the
dear
i
would
not
miss
it
for
i
had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
holmes
in
his
professional
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
as
swift
as
and
yet
always
founded
on
a
logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
i
rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in
a
few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
a
lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
rose
as
we
said
holmes
name
is
sherlock
this
is
my
intimate

raised
her

see
that
she

indeed
in

pitiable
state
of
her
face
all
drawn

with
restless
frightened

of

suits
you

now
i
beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
replied
our
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
which
might
seem
trivial
to
that

of
all
others
i
have
a
right
to
look
for

the
fancies
of
a

he
does
not

i
can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers

i
have
that
you
can

deeply
into

he
married
my
the
young
widow
of
of
the

my
sister
julia
and
i
were
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother's
she
had
a
considerable
sum
of
less
than
pounds
a
this
she
bequeathed
to
entirely
while
we
resided
with
with
a
provision
that
a
certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
shortly
after
our
return
to
england
my
mother
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in
a
railway
accident
near
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
london
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
stoke
the
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
a
terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
instead
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see
a
of
stoke
moran
back
in
the
old
family
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
violence
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
and
in
my
case
it
i
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
a
series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
two
of
which
ended
in
the
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
for
he
is
a
man
of
immense
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over
a
parapet
into
a
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which
i
could
gather
together
that
i
was
able
to
avert
another
public
he
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
land
which
represent
the
family
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
he
has
a
passion
also
for
indian
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by
a
and
he
has
at
this
moment
a
cheetah
and
a
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
can
imagine
from
what
i
say
that
my
poor
sister
julia
and
i
had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
no
servant
would
stay
with
and
for
a
long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
she
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
even
as
mine
sister
is
died
just
two
years
and
it
is
of
her
death
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
can
understand
living
the
life
which
i
have
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
we
an
my
mother's
maiden
miss
who
lives
near
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
lady's
julia
went
there
at
christmas
two
years
and
met
there
a
major
of
to
whom
she
became
my
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
but
within
a
fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
sherlock
holmes
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in
a
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
be
precise
as
to
said
is
easy
for
me
to
be
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
the
as
i
have
already
very
and
only
one
wing
is
now
the
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
the
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
of
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
the
second
my
and
the
third
my
there
is
no
communication
between
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
do
i
make
myself
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
that
fatal
night
had
gone
to
his
room
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
indian
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
she
left
her
and
came
into
where
she
sat
for
some
chatting
about
her
approaching
at
eleven
o'clock
she
rose
to
leave
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
said
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
said
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
in
your
but
during
the
last
few
nights
i
have
about
three
in
the
heard
a
clear
i
am
a
light
and
it
has
awakened
i
cannot
tell
where
it
came
from
the
next
perhaps
from
the
i
thought
that
i
would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
i
have
it
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
and
yet
if
it
were
on
the
i
wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
but
i
sleep
more
heavily
than
it
is
of
no
great
at
any
she
smiled
back
at
closed
my
and
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
her
key
turn
in
the
said
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
think
that
i
mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept
a
cheetah
and
a
we
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
pray
proceed
with
your
could
not
sleep
that
a
vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
my
sister
and
you
will
were
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
it
was
a
wild
the
wind
was
howling
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of
a
terrified
i
knew
that
it
was
my
sister's
i
sprang
from
my
wrapped
a
shawl
round
and
rushed
into
the
as
i
opened
my
door
i
seemed
to
hear
a
low
such
as
my
sister
and
a
few
moments
later
a
clanging
as
if
a
mass
of
metal
had
as
i
ran
down
the
my
sister's
door
was
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
i
stared
at
it
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
by
the
light
of
the
i
saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
her
face
blanched
with
her
hands
groping
for
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of
a
i
ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
she
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
at
first
i
thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
but
as
i
bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in
a
voice
which
i
shall
never
my
it
was
the
the
speckled
there
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor's
but
a
fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
i
rushed
calling
loudly
for
my
and
i
met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
when
he
reached
my
sister's
side
she
was
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
all
efforts
were
in
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
such
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
said
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
could
you
swear
to
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
it
is
my
strong
impression
that
i
heard
and
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
i
may
possibly
have
been
your
sister
she
was
in
her
in
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of
a
and
in
her
left
a
that
she
had
struck
a
light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
that
is
and
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
investigated
the
case
with
great
for
conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
my
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
shutters
with
broad
iron
which
were
secured
every
the
walls
were
carefully
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
with
the
same
the
chimney
is
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
it
is
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
about
doctors
examined
her
for
but
without
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
though
what
it
was
that
frightened
her
i
cannot
there
gipsies
in
the
plantation
at
the
there
are
nearly
always
some
and
what
did
you
gather
from
this
allusion
to
a
speckled
i
have
thought
that
it
was
merely
the
wild
talk
of
sometimes
that
it
may
have
referred
to
some
band
of
perhaps
to
these
very
gipsies
in
the
i
do
not
know
whether
the
spotted
handkerchiefs
which
so
many
of
them
wear
over
their
heads
might
have
suggested
the
strange
adjective
which
she
holmes
shook
his
head
like
a
man
who
is
far
from
being
are
very
deep
said
go
on
with
your
years
have
passed
since
and
my
life
has
been
until
lately
lonelier
than
a
month
a
dear

i
have
known
for
many

done
me
the
honour
to
ask
my
hand

stepfather

offered
no
opposition
to
the
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
the
two
days
ago
some
repairs
were
started
in
the
west
wing
of
the
and
my
bedroom
wall
has
been
so
that
i
have
had
to
move
into
the
chamber
in
which
my
sister
and
to
sleep
in
the
very
bed
in
which
she
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
as
i
lay
thinking
over
her
terrible
i
suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
the
herald
of
her
own
i
sprang
up
and
lit
the
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
i
was
too
shaken
to
go
to
bed
so
i
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
i
slipped
got
a
at
the
crown
which
is
and
drove
to
from
whence
i
have
come
on
this
morning

the
one
object
of
seeing
you
and
asking
your

frill
of

fringed

visitor's

perhaps
he
hardly
knows

own

was
a
long
during
which
holmes
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
is
a
very
deep
he
said
at
are
a
thousand
details
which
i
should
desire
to
know
before
i
decide
upon
our
course
of
yet
we
have
not
a
moment
to
if
we
were
to
come
to

would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
see
over
these
rooms
without
the
knowledge
of
your

spoke
of
coming
into

is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
we
have
a
housekeeper
but
she
is
old
and
and
i
could
easily
get
her
out
of
the
you
are
not
averse
to
this
no

shall
both
what
are
you
going
to
do
have
one
or
two
things
which
i
would
wish
to
do
now
that
i
am
in

i
shall
return
by
the
twelve
o'clock
so
as
to
be
there
in
time
for
your
you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
i
have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
will
you
not
wait
and
i
must
my
heart
is
lightened
already
since
i
have
confided
my
trouble
to
i
shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
she
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face
and
glided
from
the
what
do
you
think
of
it
asked
sherlock
leaning
back
in
his
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
dark
and
sinister
enough
and
sinister
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
and
that
the
and
chimney
are
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
of
these
nocturnal
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
cannot
you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
the
presence
of
a
band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
the
dying
allusion
to
a
the
fact
that
miss
helen
stoner
heard
a
metallic
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
i
think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
did
the
gipsies
cannot
see
many
objections
to
any
such
so
do
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
stoke
moran
this
i
want
to
see
whether
the
objections
are
or
if
they
may
be
explained
but
what
in
the
name
of
the
the
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
and
that
a
huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
his
costume
was
a
peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of
the
having
a
black
a
long
and
a
pair
of
high
with
a
swinging
in
his
so
tall
was
he
that
his
hat
actually
brushed
the
cross
bar
of
the
and
his
breadth
seemed
to
span
it
across
from
side
to
a
large
seared
with
a
thousand

yellow

the

marked
with
every
evil

turned
from

to
the
other

while
his
and

gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to
a
fierce
old
bird
of
of
you
is
asked
this
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
said
my
companion

of
the
my
stepdaughter
has

little
cold
for
the
time

his

most
said
you
go
out
close

for
there
is
a
decided
will

when
i

my
don't
you

to
meddle
with
my
i
know
that

has
been

am
a
dangerous
man
to
fall
foul

he
stepped
swiftly
seized
the
and
bent
it
into
a
curve
with
his
huge
brown
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of

hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out

a
very
amiable

not
quite
so

if
he
had
remained
i
might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
as
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
with
a
sudden
straightened
it
out
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official
detective
this
incident
gives
zest
to
our
and
i
only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
and
we
shall
order
and
afterwards
i
shall
walk
down
to
where
i
hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us
in
this
it
was
nearly
one
o'clock
when
sherlock
holmes
returned
from
his
he
held
in
his
hand
a
sheet
of
blue
scrawled
over
with
notes
and
have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
said
determine
its
exact
meaning
i
have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the
present
prices
of
the
investments
with
which
it
is
the
total
which
at
the
time
of
the
wife's
death
was
little
short
of
is
through
the
fall
in
agricultural
not
more
than
each
daughter
can
claim
an
income
of
in
case
of
it
is
that
if
both
girls
had
this
beauty
would
have
had
a
mere
while
even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to
a
very
serious
my
work
has
not
been
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
and
this
is
too
serious
for
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
so
if
you
are
we
shall
call
a
cab
and
drive
to
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
slip
your
revolver
into
your
an
is
an
excellent
argument
with
gentlemen
who
can
twist
steel
into
that
and
a
i
all
that
we
at
waterloo
we
were
fortunate
in
catching
a
train
for
where
we
hired
a
trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
surrey
it
was
a
perfect
with
a
bright
sun
and
a
few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
the
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
to
me
at
least
there
was
a
strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
my
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
his
arms
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
buried
in
the
deepest
he
tapped
me
on
the
and
pointed
over
the
said
a
heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in
a
gentle
thickening
into
a
grove
at
the
highest
from
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
of
a
very
old
said
that
be
the
house
of
remarked
the
is
some
building
going
on
said
is
where
we
are
the
said
the
pointing
to
a
cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
you'll
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
and
so
by
the
over
the
there
it
where
the
lady
is
the
i
is
miss
observed
shading
his
i
think
we
had
better
do
as
you
we
got
paid
our
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
thought
it
as
said
holmes
as
we
climbed
the
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
or
on
some
definite
it
may
stop
his
miss
you
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
our
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with
a
face
which
spoke
her
have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
she
shaking
hands
with
us
has
turned
out
has
gone
to
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor's
said
and
in
a
few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
miss
stoner
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
she
has
followed
it
is
so
cunning
that
i
never
know
when
i
am
safe
from
what
will
he
say
when
he
must
guard
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
you
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
if
he
is
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt's
at
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
the
building
was
of
with
a
high
central
portion
and
two
curving
like
the
claws
of
a
thrown
out
on
each
in
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
a
picture
of
the
central
portion
was
in
little
better
but
the
block
was
comparatively
and
the
blinds
in
the
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
some
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
and
the
had
been
broken
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
holmes
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
of
the
i
take
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
the
centre
one
to
your
and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
but
i
am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
the
as
i
by
the
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
were
i
believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
that
is
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
there
are
windows
in
of
but
very
small
too
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
miss
stoner
did
and
after
a
careful
examination
through
the
open
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
but
without
there
was
no
slit
through
which
a
knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
then
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
but
they
were
of
solid
built
firmly
into
the
massive
said
scratching
his
chin
in
some
theory
certainly
presents
some
no
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
a
small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
holmes
refused
to
examine
the
third
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
that
in
which
miss
stoner
was
now
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
it
was
a
homely
little
with
a
low
ceiling
and
a
gaping
after
the
fashion
of
old
a
brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
a
narrow
bed
in
and
a
on
the
side
of
the
these
with
two
small
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for
a
square
of
wilton
carpet
in
the
the
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
holmes
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into
a
corner
and
sat
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
does
that
bell
communicate
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to
a
thick
which
hung
down
beside
the
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
goes
to
the
housekeeper's
looks
newer
than
the
other
it
was
only
put
there
a
couple
of
years
sister
asked
for
i
i
never
heard
of
her
using
we
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice
a
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
satisfy
myself
as
to
this
he
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
then
he
did
the
same
with
the
with
which
the
chamber
was
finally
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
finally
he
took
the
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
a
brisk
it's
a
said
it
it
is
not
even
attached
to
a
this
is
very
you
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to
a
hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
very
i
never
noticed
that
muttered
pulling
at
the
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
for
what
a
fool
a
builder
must
be
to
open
a
ventilator
into
another
with
the
same
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
is
also
quite
said
the
about
the
same
time
as
the
remarked
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
seem
to
have
been
of
a
most
interesting
and
which
do
not
with
your
miss
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
but
was
as
plainly
a
a
small
wooden
shelf
full
of
mostly
of
a
technical
an
armchair
beside
the
a
plain
wooden
chair
against
the
a
round
and
a
large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
holmes
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
in
he
tapping
the
business
you
have
seen
some
years
i
remember
that
it
was
full
of
isn't
a
cat
in
for
what
a
strange
look
at
he
took
up
a
small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
we
don't
keep
a
but
there
is
a
cheetah
and
a
of
a
cheetah
is
just
a
big
and
yet
a
saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
i
there
is
one
point
which
i
should
wish
to
he
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
that
is
quite
said
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
here
is
something
the
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was
a
small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
the
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make
a
loop
of
do
you
make
of
a
common
enough
but
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
is
not
quite
so
is
it's
a
wicked
and
when
a
clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
i
think
that
i
have
seen
enough
miss
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
i
had
never
seen
my
friend's
face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
we
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
neither
miss
stoner
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
is
very
miss
said
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
shall
most
certainly
do
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
your
life
may
depend
upon
your
assure
you
that
i
am
in
your
the
first
both
my
friend
and
i
must
spend
the
night
in
your
both
miss
stoner
and
i
gazed
at
him
in
it
must
be
let
me
i
believe
that
that
is
the
village
inn
over
that
is
the
your
windows
would
be
visible
from
must
confine
yourself
to
your
on
pretence
of
a
when
your
stepfather
comes
then
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
you
must
open
the
shutters
of
your
undo
the
put
your
lamp
there
as
a
signal
to
and
then
withdraw
quietly
with
everything
which
you
are
likely
to
want
into
the
room
which
you
used
to
i
have
no
doubt
in
spite
of
the
you
could
manage
there
for
one
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
what
will
you
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
and
we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
that
you
have
already
made
up
your
said
miss
laying
her
hand
upon
my
companion's
i
for
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
sister's
should
prefer
to
have
clearer
proofs
before
i
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
and
if
she
died
from
some
sudden
i
do
not
think
i
think
that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible
and
miss
we
must
leave
you
for
if
returned
and
saw
us
our
journey
would
be
in
and
be
for
if
you
will
do
what
i
have
told
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
soon
drive
away
the
dangers
that
threaten
sherlock
holmes
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
engaging
a
bedroom
and
at
the
crown
they
were
on
the
upper
and
from
our
window
we
could
command
a
view
of
the
avenue
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
stoke
moran
manor
at
dusk
we
saw
drive
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
the
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor's
voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
the
trap
drove
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
saw
a
sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
you
said
holmes
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
there
is
a
distinct
element
of
i
be
of
presence
might
be
i
shall
certainly
is
very
kind
of
speak
of
you
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
but
i
fancy
that
i
may
have
deduced
a
little
i
imagine
that
you
saw
all
that
i
saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer
i
confess
is
more
than
i
can
saw
the
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
a
very
unusual
thing
to
have
a
small
opening
between
two
it
was
so
small
that
a
rat
could
hardly
pass
knew
that
we
should
find
a
ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
stoke
dear
i
you
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
of
course
that
suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be
a
communication
between
the
two
it
could
only
be
a
small
or
it
would
have
been
remarked
upon
at
the
i
deduced
a
what
harm
can
there
be
in
there
is
at
least
a
curious
coincidence
of
a
ventilator
is
a
cord
is
and
a
lady
who
sleeps
in
the
bed
does
not
that
strike
cannot
as
yet
see
any
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that
was
clamped
to
the
did
you
ever
see
a
bed
fastened
like
that
cannot
say
that
i
lady
could
not
move
her
it
must
always
be
in
the
same
relative
position
to
the
ventilator
and
to
the
so
we
may
call
since
it
was
clearly
never
meant
for
a
i
seem
to
see
dimly
what
you
are
hinting
we
are
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
some
subtle
and
horrible
enough
and
horrible
when
a
doctor
does
go
wrong
he
is
the
first
of
he
has
nerve
and
he
has
palmer
and
pritchard
were
among
the
heads
of
their
this
man
strikes
even
but
i
that
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
deeper
but
we
shall
have
horrors
enough
before
the
night
is
for
sake
let
us
have
a
quiet
pipe
and
turn
our
minds
for
a
few
hours
to
something
more
about
nine
o'clock
the
light
among
the
trees
was
and
all
was
dark
in
the
direction
of
the
manor
two
hours
passed
slowly
and
just
at
the
stroke
of
a
single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in
front
of
is
our
said
springing
to
his
comes
from
the
middle
as
we
passed
out
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
explaining
that
we
were
going
on
a
late
visit
to
an
and
that
it
was
possible
that
we
might
spend
the
night
a
moment
later
we
were
out
on
the
dark
a
chill
wind
blowing
in
our
and
one
yellow
light
twinkling
in
front
of
us
through
the
gloom
to
guide
us
on
our
sombre
there
was
little
difficulty
in
entering
the
for
breaches
gaped
in
the
old
park
making
our
way
among
the
we
reached
the
crossed
and
were
about
to
enter
through
the
window
when
out
from
a
clump
of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be
a
hideous
and
distorted
who
threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs
and
then
ran
swiftly
across
the
lawn
into
the
i
you
see
holmes
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as
his
hand
closed
like
a
vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
then
he
broke
into
a
low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
is
a
nice
he
is
the
i
had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
there
was
a
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
i
confess
that
i
felt
easier
in
my
mind
after
following
example
and
slipping
off
my
i
found
myself
inside
the
my
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
all
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
then
creeping
up
to
me
and
making
a
trumpet
of
his
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
distinguish
the
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
i
nodded
to
show
that
i
had
must
sit
without
he
would
see
it
through
the
i
nodded
not
go
your
very
life
may
depend
upon
have
your
pistol
ready
in
case
we
should
need
i
will
sit
on
the
side
of
the
and
you
in
that
i
took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
holmes
had
brought
up
a
long
thin
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
by
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of
a
then
he
turned
down
the
and
we
were
left
in
how
shall
i
ever
forget
that
dreadful
i
could
not
hear
a
not
even
the
drawing
of
a
and
yet
i
knew
that
my
companion
sat
within
a
few
feet
of
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
i
was
the
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
and
we
waited
in
absolute
from
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of
a
and
once
at
our
very
window
a
long
drawn
catlike
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
far
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
how
long
they
those
twelve
and
one
and
two
and
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
suddenly
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of
a
light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
which
vanished
but
was
succeeded
by
a
strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
someone
in
the
next
room
had
lit
a
i
heard
a
gentle
sound
of
and
then
all
was
silent
once
though
the
smell
grew
for
half
an
hour
i
sat
with
straining
then
suddenly
another
sound
became
very
soothing
like
that
of
a
small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from
a
the
instant
that
we
heard
holmes
sprang
from
the
struck
a
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
see
he
see
but
i
saw
at
the
moment
when
holmes
struck
the
light
i
heard
a
clear
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
i
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
he
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which
i
have
ever
it
swelled
up
louder
and
a
hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
they
say
that
away
down
in
the
and
even
in
the
distant
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
it
struck
cold
to
our
and
i
stood
gazing
at
and
he
at
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
can
it
i
means
that
it
is
all
holmes
after
it
is
for
the
take
your
and
we
will
enter
with
a
grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
twice
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
then
he
turned
the
handle
and
i
at
his
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
it
was
a
singular
sight
which
met
our
on
the
table
stood
a
with
the
shutter
half
throwing
a
brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
the
door
of
which
was
beside
this
on
the
wooden
sat
clad
in
a
long
grey
his
bare
ankles
protruding
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
turkish
across
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
his
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
round
his
brow
he
had
a
peculiar
yellow
with
brownish
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
as
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
the
speckled
whispered
i
took
a
step
in
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
head
and
puffed
neck
of
a
loathsome
is
a
swamp
cried
deadliest
snake
in
he
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
violence
in
recoil
upon
the
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
let
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
and
we
can
then
remove
miss
stoner
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
as
he
spoke
he
drew
the
swiftly
from
the
dead
man's
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile's
neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
carrying
it
at
arm's
threw
it
into
the
iron
which
he
closed
upon
such
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
of
stoke
it
is
not
necessary
that
i
should
prolong
a
narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great
a
length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with
a
dangerous
the
little
which
i
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
sherlock
holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
said
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
my
dear
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
the
presence
of
the
and
the
use
of
the
word
which
was
used
by
the
poor
no
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught
a
hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
i
can
only
claim
the
merit
that
i
instantly
reconsidered
my
position
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
my
attention
was
speedily
as
i
have
already
remarked
to
to
this
and
to
the
which
hung
down
to
the
the
discovery
that
this
was
a
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as
a
bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
the
idea
of
a
snake
instantly
occurred
to
and
when
i
coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with
a
supply
of
creatures
from
i
felt
that
i
was
probably
on
the
right
the
idea
of
using
a
form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such
a
one
as
would
occur
to
a
clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
had
an
eastern
the
rapidity
with
which
such
a
poison
would
take
effect
would
from
his
point
of
be
an
it
would
be
a
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
then
i
thought
of
the
of
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
he
had
trained
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
to
return
to
him
when
he
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
it
might
or
might
not
bite
the
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for
a
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall
a
had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever
i
had
entered
his
an
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
the
sight
of
the
the
saucer
of
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
the
metallic
clang
heard
by
miss
stoner
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
having
once
made
up
my
you
know
the
steps
which
i
took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
i
heard
the
creature
hiss
as
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
did
and
i
instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
the
result
of
driving
it
through
the
also
with
the
result
of
causing
it
to
turn
upon
its
master
at
the
other
some
of
the
blows
of
my
cane
came
home
and
roused
its
so
that
it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
in
this
way
i
am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
and
i
cannot
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
the
adventure
of
the
engineer's
thumb
of
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
sherlock
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
there
were
only
two
which
i
was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
of
and
that
of
colonel
of
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded
a
finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
the
story
i
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
like
all
such
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in
a
single
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes
a
step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
at
the
time
the
circumstances
made
a
deep
impression
upon
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
it
was
in
the
summer
of
not
long
after
my
that
the
events
occurred
which
i
am
now
about
to
i
had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
holmes
in
his
baker
street
although
i
continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
bohemian
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
my
practice
had
steadily
and
as
i
happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
i
got
a
few
patients
from
among
the
one
of
whom
i
had
cured
of
a
painful
and
lingering
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
one
at
a
little
before
seven
i
was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
and
were
waiting
in
the
i
dressed
for
i
knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
and
hastened
as
i
my
old
the
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
got
him
he
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
all
is
i
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
a
new
he
thought
i'd
bring
him
round
then
he
couldn't
slip
there
he
all
safe
and
i
must
go
i
have
my
just
the
same
as
and
off
he
this
trusty
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
i
entered
my
and
found
a
gentleman
seated
by
the
he
was
quietly
dressed
in
a
suit
of
heather
tweed
with
a
soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
round
one
of
his
hands
he
had
a
handkerchief
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
he
was
not
more
than
i
should
with
a
masculine
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
said
i
have
had
a
very
serious
accident
during
the
i
came
in
by
train
this
and
on
inquiring
at
as
to
where
i
might
find
a
a
worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
i
gave
the
maid
a
but
i
see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
i
took
it
up
and
glanced
at
victor
hydraulic
victoria
street
that
was
the
and
abode
of
my
morning
regret
that
i
have
kept
you
said
sitting
down
in
my
are
fresh
from
a
night
i
which
is
in
itself
a
monotonous
my
night
could
not
be
called
said
and
he
laughed
very
with
a
ringing
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
all
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
i
yourself
and
i
poured
out
some
water
from
a
it
was
he
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon
a
strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
presently
he
came
to
himself
once
very
weary
and
have
been
making
a
fool
of
he
at
drink
i
dashed
some
brandy
into
the
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
said
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
he
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
it
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves
a
shudder
to
look
at
there
were
four
protruding
fingers
and
a
horrid
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
it
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
i
is
a
terrible
it
must
have
bled
it
i
fainted
when
it
was
and
i
think
that
i
must
have
been
senseless
for
a
long
when
i
came
to
i
found
that
it
was
still
so
i
tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with
a
you
should
have
been
a
is
a
question
of
you
and
came
within
my
own
has
been
said
examining
the
a
very
heavy
and
sharp
thing
like
a
said
i
no
a
murderous
murderous
horrify
i
sponged
the
cleaned
dressed
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
he
lay
back
without
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
is
i
asked
when
i
had
between
your
brandy
and
your
i
feel
a
new
i
was
very
but
i
have
had
a
good
deal
to
go
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
it
is
evidently
trying
to
your
not
i
shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
between
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
for
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
and
i
have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
even
if
they
believe
the
clues
which
i
can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is
a
question
whether
justice
will
be
cried
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
problem
which
you
desire
to
see
i
should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
sherlock
before
you
go
to
the
official
i
have
heard
of
that
answered
my
i
should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
though
of
course
i
must
use
the
official
police
as
would
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
do
i'll
take
you
round
to
him

be
immensely
obliged
to
call
a
cab
and
go
we
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have
a
little
breakfast
with

you
feel
equal

shall
not

until
i
have
told
my
my
servant

call
a
and
i
shall
be
with
you
in
an

the
matter
shortly
to
my
and
in

minutes

have
felt
another

i

that

completed

take
up

little
of
your
valuable

shall

upon

in
his
big
armchair
with
the
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
while
i
sat
opposite
to
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
must
said
i
am
an
orphan
and
a
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
by
profession
i
am
a
hydraulic
and
i
have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that
i
was
apprenticed
to
the
of
two
years
having
served
my
and
having
also
come
into
a
fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father's
i
determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
victoria
suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business
a
dreary
to
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
during
two
years
i
have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
my
gross
takings
amount
to
pounds
every
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
i
waited
in
my
little
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
and
i
came
to
believe
that
i
should
never
have
any
practice
at
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
leaving
the
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
he
brought
up
a
with
the
name
of
lysander
engraved
upon
close
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
a
man
rather
over
the
middle
but
of
an
exceeding
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
so
thin
a
his
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
yet
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
and
due
to
no
for
his
eye
was
his
step
and
his
bearing
he
was
plainly
but
neatly
and
his
i
should
would
be
nearer
forty
than
said
with
something
of
a
german
have
been
recommended
to
as
being
a
man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving
a
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
i
ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good
a
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
i
have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and
a
bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
is
quite
i
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
cannot
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
i
understand
that
it
was
on
a
professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
but
you
will
find
that
all
i
say
is
really
to
the
i
have
a
professional
commission
for
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
you
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from
a
man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his

promise
to
keep

absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
looked
very
hard
at
me
as
i
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
you
said
he
at
i
and
complete
silence
and
no
reference
to
the
matter
at
either
in
word
or
have
already
given
you
my
he
suddenly
sprang
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
the
passage
outside
was
all
said
coming
know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master's
now
we
can
talk
in
he
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
feeling
of
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
even
my
dread
of
losing
a
client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
beg
that
you
will
state
your
said
time
is
of
heaven
forgive
me
for
that
last
but
the
words
came
to
my
would
fifty
guineas
for
a
night's
work
suit
he
say
a
night's
but
an
hour's
would
be
nearer
the
i
simply
want
your
opinion
about
a
hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
if
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
what
do
you
think
of
such
a
commission
as
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
we
shall
want
you
to
come
by
the
last
in
it
is
a
little
place
near
the
borders
of
and
within
seven
miles
of
there
is
a
train
from
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
shall
come
down
in
a
carriage
to
meet
is
a
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
it
is
a
good
seven
miles
from
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of
a
train
i
should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
we
could
easily
give
you
a
is
very
could
i
not
come
at
some
more
convenient
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
it
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
a
young
and
unknown
a
fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
of
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
thought
of
the
fifty
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
at
said
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
i
should
to
understand
a
little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
it
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
i
have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
i
suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
the
matter
stands
you
are
probably
aware
that
is
a
valuable
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
have
heard
little
time
ago
i
bought
a
small
very
small
ten
miles
of
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was
a
deposit
of
in
one
of
my
on
examining
i
found
that
this
deposit
was
a
comparatively
small
and
that
it
formed
a
link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
of
in
the
grounds
of
my
these
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as
a
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
but
unfortunately
i
had
no
capital
by
which
i
could
do
i
took
a
few
of
my
friends
into
the
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
this
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected
a
hydraulic
this
as
i
have
already
has
got
out
of
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
we
guard
our
secret
very
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
it
would
soon
rouse
and
if
the
facts
came
it
would
be
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
that
is
why
i
have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell
a
human
being
that
you
are
going
to
i
hope
that
i
make
it
all
quite
follow
said
only
point
which
i
could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of
a
hydraulic
press
in
excavating
as
i
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from
a
said
he
have
our
own
we
compress
the
earth
into
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
but
that
is
a
mere
i
have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
and
i
have
shown
you
how
i
trust
he
rose
as
he
shall
expect
at
at
shall
certainly
be
not
a
word
to
a
he
looked
at
me
with
a
last
questioning
and
pressing
my
hand
in
a
dank
he
hurried
from
the
when
i
came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood
i
was
very
much
as
you
may
both
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
to
on
the
one
of
i
was
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what
i
should
have
asked
had
i
set
a
price
upon
my
own
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
on
the
other
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
and
i
could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest
i
should
tell
anyone
of
my
i
threw
all
fears
to
the
ate
a
hearty
drove
to
and
started
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
reading
i
had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
i
was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
and
i
reached
the
little
station
after
eleven
i
was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save
a
single
sleepy
porter
with
a
as
i
passed
out
through
the
wicket
i
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
without
a
word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into
a
the
door
of
which
was
standing
he
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
tapped
on
the
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
interjected
only
you
observe
the
i
saw
it
by
the
when
i
was
stepping
into
the
it
was
a
or
fresh
and
i
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
pray
continue
your
most
interesting
we
went
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
colonel
lysander
stark
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
but
i
should
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
and
from
the
time
that
we
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
he
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
and
i
was
more
than
once
when
i
glanced
in
his
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
the
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
i
tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
and
i
could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of
a
passing
now
and
then
i
hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
and
the
conversation
soon
at
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of
a
and
the
carriage
came
to
a
colonel
lysander
stark
sprang
as
i
followed
after
pulled
me
swiftly
into
a
porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
we
as
it
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
so
that
i
failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
the
instant
that
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
and
i
heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
suddenly
a
door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
and
a
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
it
grew
and
a
woman
appeared
with
a
lamp
in
her
which
she
held
above
her
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
i
could
see
that
she
was
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress
i
knew
that
it
was
a
rich
she
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
in
a
tone
as
though
asking
a
and
when
my
companion
answered
in
a
gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such
a
start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
colonel
stark
went
up
to
whispered
something
in
her
and
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for
a
few
said
throwing
open
another
it
was
a
plainly
furnished
with
a
round
table
in
the
on
which
several
german
books
were

laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of
a
harmonium
beside
the
shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
said
and
vanished
into
the
glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
german
i
could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
the
others
being
volumes
of
then
i
walked
across
to
the
hoping
that
i
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
but
an
oak
heavily
was
folded
across
it
was
a
wonderfully
silent
there
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
a
vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
who
were
these
german
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
and
where
was
the
i
was
ten
miles
or
so
from
that
was
all
i
but
whether
or
west
i
had
no
for
that
and
possibly
other
large
were
within
that
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
after
yet
it
was
quite
from
the
absolute
that
we
were
in
the
i
paced
up
and
down
the
humming
a
tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that
i
was
thoroughly
earning
my
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
the
woman
was
standing
in
the
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
she
was
sick
with
and
the
sight
sent
a
chill
to
my
own
she
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
and
she
shot
a
few
whispered
words
of
broken
english
at
her
eyes
glancing
like
those
of
a
frightened
into
the
gloom
behind

seeing
that
i
smiled
and
shook
my

suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made
a
step
with
her
hands
wrung
the
love
of
she
away
from
here
before
it

somewhat
headstrong

the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in

of
my
of
my
wearisome
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before

it
all
to
go
for
why
should
i
slink
away
without
having
carried
out

and
without

her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than
i
cared
to

still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where
i
she
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
a
door
slammed
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
she
listened
for

up
her
hands
with
a
despairing
and
vanished

suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had

colonel
lysander
stark
and
a
short
thick
man
with
a
chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
is
my
secretary
and
said
the
the
i
was
under
the
impression
that
i
left
this
door
shut
just
i
fear
that
you
have
felt
the
the
said
opened
the
door
myself
because
i
felt
the
room
to
be
a
little
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
we
had
better
proceed
to
said
ferguson
and
i
will
take
you
up
to
see
the
had
better
put
my
hat
i
it
is
in
the
you
dig
in
the
this
is
only
where
we
compress
but
never
mind
all
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
went
upstairs
the
colonel
first
with
the
the
fat
manager
and
i
behind
it
was
a
labyrinth
of
an
old
with
narrow
winding
and
little
low
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
there
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
unhealthy
i
tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
but
i
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
even
though
i
disregarded
and
i
kept
a
keen
eye
upon
my
two
ferguson
appeared
to
be
a
morose
and
silent
but
i
could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least
a
lysander
stark
stopped
at
last
before
a
low
which
he
within
was
a
square
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
ferguson
remained
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
are
said
within
the
hydraulic
and
it
would
be
a
particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
the
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
there
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
the
machine
goes
readily
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
and
it
has
lost
a
little
of
its
perhaps
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
took
the
lamp
from
and
i
examined
the
machine
very
it
was
indeed
a
gigantic
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
when
i
passed
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
i
knew
at
once
by
the
sound
that
there
was
a
slight
which
allowed
a
regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
an
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of
a
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
this
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
and
i
pointed
it
out
to
my
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
when
i
had
made
it
clear
to
i
returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took
a
good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
it
was
obvious
at
a
glance
that
the
story
of
the
was
the
merest
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate
a
the
walls
were
of
but
the
floor
consisted
of
a
large
iron
and
when
i
came
to
examine
it
i
could
see
a
crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
i
had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when
i
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
in
german
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
are
you
doing
he
felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate
a
story
as
that
which
he
had
told
was
admiring
your
said
think
that
i
should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if
i
knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
instant
that
i
uttered
the
words
i
regretted
the
rashness
of
my
his
face
set
and
a
baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
said
shall
know
all
about
the
he
took
a
step
slammed
the
little
and
turned
the
key
in
the
i
rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
but
it
was
quite
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
i
let
me
then
suddenly
in
the
silence
i
heard
a
sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
it
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
he
had
set
the
engine
at
the
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where
i
had
placed
it
when
examining
the
by
its
light
i
saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
as
none
knew
better
than
with
a
force
which
must
within
a
minute
grind
me
to
a
shapeless
i
threw
against
the
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
i
implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
the
ceiling
was
only
a
foot
or
two
above
my
and
with
my
hand
upraised
i
could
feel
its
rough
then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which
i
met
if
i
lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
and
i
shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
easier
the
other
and
had
i
the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
already
i
was
unable
to
stand
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought
a
gush
of
hope
back
to
my
have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
the
walls
were
of
as
i
gave
a
last
hurried
glance
i
saw
a
thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
which
broadened
and
broadened
as
a
small
panel
was
pushed
for
an
instant
i
could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed
a
door
which
led
away
from
the
next
instant
i
threw
myself
and
lay
upon
the
other
the
panel
had
closed
again
behind
but
the
crash
of
the
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
was
recalled
to
myself
by
a
frantic
plucking
at
my
and
i
found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of
a
narrow
while
a
woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
while
she
held
a
candle
in
her
it
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning
i
had
so
foolishly
she
cried
will
be
here
in
a
they
will
see
that
you
are
not
do
not
waste
the
but
at
i
did
not
scorn
her
i
staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down
a
winding
the
latter
led
to
another
broad
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
my
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit's
then
she
threw
open
a
door
which
led
into
a
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
is
your
only
said
is
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
she
spoke
a
light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
and
i
saw
the
lean
figure
of
colonel
lysander
stark
rushing
forward
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
weapon
like
a
butcher's
cleaver
in
the
i
rushed
across
the
flung
open
the
and
looked
how
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
i
clambered
out
upon
the
but
i
hesitated
to
jump
until
i
should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
if
she
were
then
at
any
risks
i
was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
the
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
pushing
his
way
past
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
she
cried
in
your
promise
after
the
last
you
said
it
should
not
be
he
will
be
he
will
be
are
he
struggling
to
break
away
from
will
be
the
ruin
of
he
has
seen
too
let
me
i
he
dashed
her
to
one
rushing
to
the
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
i
had
let
myself
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
when
his
blow
i
was
conscious
of
a
dull
my
grip
and
i
fell
into
the
garden
was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
so
i
picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as
i
could
for
i
understood
that
i
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
as
i
a
deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
i
glanced
down
at
my
which
was
throbbing
and
for
the
first
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
i
endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
but
there
came
a
sudden
buzzing
in
my
and
next
moment
i
fell
in
a
dead
faint
among
the
long
i
remained
unconscious
i
cannot
it
must
have
been
a
very
long
for
the
moon
had
and
a
bright
morning
was
breaking
when
i
came
to
my
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
and
my
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
the
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night's
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that
i
might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
but
to
my
when
i
came
to
look
round
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
i
had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
and
just
a
little
lower
down
was
a
long
which
upon
my
approaching
to
be
the
very
station
at
which
i
had
arrived
upon
the
previous
were
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
i
went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
there
would
be
one
to
reading
in
less
than
an
the
same
porter
was
on
i
as
had
been
there
when
i
i
inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
colonel
lysander
the
name
was
strange
to
had
he
observed
a
carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
he
had
was
there
a
anywhere
there
was
one
about
three
miles
was
too
far
for
me
to
weak
and
ill
as
i
i
determined
to
wait
until
i
got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
it
was
a
little
past
six
when
i
so
i
went
first
to
have
my
wound
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
i
put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
we
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
then
sherlock
holmes
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his

an
advertisement
which
will

o'clock

i
cried
my
that
explains
what
the
girl
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was
a
cool
and
desperate
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
like
those
pirates

busy
with
his

of

covered
their

in
a
way
that
showed
that
they

thanks
to
this

that

saw
a
gigantic
column
of
smoke

streamed
up
from
behind
a
small
clump
of
trees
in

hung
like

there
was
a

widespread
whitewashed
building

that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
the
sinister
or
the
morose
early
that
morning
a
peasant
had
met
a
cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of

there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
and
even
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
the
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
and
still
more
so
by
discovering
a
newly
severed
human
thumb
upon
a
of
the
second
about
their
efforts
were
at
last
and
they
subdued
the
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
not
a
trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
large
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
but
no
coins
were
to
be
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes
which
have
been
already
referred
how
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever
a
mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
which
told
us
a
very
plain
he
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
on
the
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
has
been
a
pretty
business
for
i
have
lost
my
thumb
and
i
have
lost
a
and
what
have
i
said
it
may
be
of
you
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
the
adventure
of
the
noble
bachelor
the
lord
simon
and
its
curious
have
long
ceased
to
be
a
subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
fresh
scandals
have
eclipsed
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
as
i
have
reason
to
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
and
as
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
had
a
considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
i
feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
it
was
a
few
weeks
before
my
own
during
the
days
when
i
was
still
sharing
rooms
with
holmes
in
baker
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find
a
letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
i
had
remained
indoors
all
for
the
weather
had
taken
a
sudden
turn
to
with
high
autumnal
and
the
bullet
which
i
had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as
a
relic
of
my
afghan
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
with
my
body
in
one
and
my
legs
upon
i
had
surrounded
myself
with
a
cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
i
tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
friend's
noble
correspondent
could
is
a
very
fashionable
i
remarked
as
he
morning
if
i
remember
were
from
a
and
a
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
he
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
this
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon
a
man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
he
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
after
distinctly
from
a
noble
of
the
highest
in
dear
i
congratulate
assure
without
that
the
status
of
my
client
is
a
matter
of
less
moment
to
me
than
the
interest
of
his
it
is
just
that
that
also
may
not
be
wanting
in
this
new
you
have
been
reading
the
papers
diligently
of
have
you
looks
like
said
i
pointing
to
a
huge
bundle
in
the
have
had
nothing
else
to
is
for
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
post
me
i
read
nothing
except
the
criminal
news
and
the
agony
the
latter
is
always
but
if
you
have
followed
recent
events
so
closely
you
must
have
read
about
lord
simon
and
his
with
the
deepest
is
the
letter
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
is
from
lord
i
will
read
it
to
and
in
return
you
must
turn
over
these
papers
and
let
me
have
whatever
bears
upon
the
this
is
what
he
dear
sherlock
backwater
tells
me
that
i
may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
your
judgment
and
i
have
to
call
upon
you
and
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
the
very
painful
event
which
has
occurred
in
connection
with
my
of
scotland
is
acting
already
in
the
but
he
assures
me
that
he
sees
no
objection
to
your
and
that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might
be
of
some
i
will
call
at
four
o'clock
in
the
should
you
have
any
other
engagement
at
that
i
hope
that
you
will
postpone
as
this
matter
is
of
paramount
yours
is
dated
from
grosvenor
written
with
a
quill
and
the
noble
lord
has
had
the
misfortune
to
get
a
smear
of
ink
upon
the
outer
side
of
his
right
little
remarked
holmes
as
he
folded
up
the
says
four
it
is
three
he
will
be
here
in
an
i
have
just
with
your
to
get
clear
upon
the
turn
over
those
papers
and
arrange
the
extracts
in
their
order
of
while
i
take
a
glance
as
to
who
our
client
he
picked
a
volume
from
a
line
of
books
of
reference
beside
the

said

down

flattening

on
the
distaff
there
is
nothing
very
instructive
in
all
i
think
that
i
must
turn
to
you
for
something
more
have
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
what
i
said
the
facts
are
quite
and
the
matter
struck
me
as
i
feared
to
refer
them
to
as
i
knew
that
you
had
an
inquiry
on
hand
and
that
you
disliked
the
intrusion
of
other
you
mean
the
little
problem
of
the
grosvenor
square
furniture
that
is
quite
cleared
up
it
was
obvious
from
the
pray
give
me
the
results
of
your
newspaper
is
the
first
notice
which
i
can
it
is
in
the
personal
column
of
the
morning
and
as
you
some
weeks
marriage
has
been
it
if
rumour
is
very
shortly
take
between
lord
robert
second
son
of
the
duke
of
and
miss
the
only
daughter
of
of
san
that
is
and
to
the
remarked
stretching
his
thin
legs
towards
the
was
a
paragraph
amplifying
this
in
one
of
the
society
papers
of
the
same
here
it
will
soon
be
a
call
for
protection
in
the
marriage
for
the
present
principle
appears
to
tell
heavily
against
our
home
one
by
one
the
management
of
the
noble
houses
of
great
britain
is
passing
into
the
hands
of
our
fair
cousins
from
across
the
an
important
addition
has
been
made
during
the
last
week
to
the
list
of
the
prizes
which
have
been
borne
away
by
these
charming
lord
who
has
shown
himself
for
over
twenty
years
proof
against
the
little
god's
has
now
definitely
announced
his
approaching
marriage
with
miss
the
fascinating
daughter
of
a
california
miss
whose
graceful
figure
and
striking
face
attracted
much
attention
at
the
house
is
an
only
and
it
is
currently
reported
that
her
dowry
will
run
to
considerably
over
the
six
with
expectancies
for
the
as
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
duke
of
balmoral
has
been
compelled
to
sell
his
pictures
within
the
last
few
and
as
lord
simon
has
no
property
of
his
own
save
the
small
estate
of
it
is
obvious
that
the
californian
heiress
is
not
the
only
gainer
by
an
alliance
which
will
enable
her
to
make
the
easy
and
common
transition
from
a
republican
lady
to
a
british
asked
then
there
is
another
note
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
that
it
would
be
at
hanover
that
only
half
a
dozen
intimate
friends
would
be
and
that
the
party
would
return
to
the
furnished
house
at
lancaster
gate
which
has
been
taken
by
two
days
on
wednesday
is
a
curt
announcement
that
the
wedding
had
taken
and
that
the
honeymoon
would
be
passed
at
lord
backwater's
near
those
are
all
the
notices
which
appeared
before
the
disappearance
of
the
the
asked
holmes
with
a
vanishing
of
the
did
she
the
wedding
this
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
quite
in
it
struck
me
as
being
a
little
out
of
the
often
vanish
before
the
and
occasionally
during
the
but
i
cannot
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
pray
let
me
have
the
warn
you
that
they
are
very
we
may
make
them
less
as
they
they
are
set
forth
in
a
single
article
of
a
morning
paper
of
which
i
will
read
to
it
is
occurrence
at
a
fashionable
family
of
lord
robert
simon
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
the
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
occurred
on
the
previous
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
in
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is
a
common
subject
for
which
was
performed
at
hanover
was
a
very
quiet
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
the
duchess
of
lord
lord
and
lady
clara
simon
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
and
lady
alicia
the
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
at
lancaster
where
breakfast
had
been
it
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by
a
whose
name
has
not
been
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
lord
it
was
only
after
a
painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
the
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
when
she
complained
of
a
sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
her
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
her
father
followed
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
caught
up
an
ulster
and
and
hurried
down
to
the
one
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
lady
leave
the
house
thus
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
believing
her
to
be
with
the
on
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
in
conjunction
with
the
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
which
will
probably
result
in
a
speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
up
to
a
late
hour
last
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
there
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
in
the
belief
from
jealousy
or
some
other
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
is
that
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
but
it
is

exceedingly
interesting

there

a
ring

no

most
painful
matter
to
as
you
can
most
readily
i
have
been
cut
to
the
i
understand
that
you
have
already
managed
several
delicate
cases
of
this
though
i
presume
that
they
were
hardly
from
the
same
class
of
i
am

client
of
the

which
king

lost

i
extend
to
the
affairs
of
my
other
clients
the
same
secrecy
which
i
promise
to
you
in
very
very
i'm
sure
i
beg
as
to
my
own
i
am
ready
to
give
you
any
information
which
may
assist
you
in
forming
an
i
have
already
learned
all
that
is
in
the
public
nothing
i
presume
that
i
may
take
it
as
this
for
as
to
the
disappearance
of
the
lord
simon
glanced
over
it
is
as
far
as
it
it
needs
a
great
deal
of
supplementing
before
anyone
could
offer
an
i
think
that
i
may
arrive
at
my
facts
most
directly
by
questioning
do
did
you
first
meet
miss
san
a
year
were
travelling
in
the
you
become
engaged
you
were
on
a
friendly
was
amused
by
her
and
she
could
see
that
i
was
father
is
very
is
said
to
be
the
richest
man
on
the
pacific
how
did
he
make
his
he
had
nothing
a
few
years
then
he
struck
invested
and
came
up
by
leaps
and
what
is
your
own
impression
as
to
the
young
wife's
the
nobleman
swung
his
glasses
a
little
faster
and
stared
down
into
the
said
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became
a
rich
during
that
time
she
ran
free
in
a
mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
nature
rather
than
from
the
she
is
what
we
call
in
england
a
with
a
strong
wild
and
unfettered
by
any
sort
of
she
is
i
was
about
to
she
is
swift
in
making
up
her
mind
and
fearless
in
carrying
out
her
on
the
other
i
would
not
have
given
her
the
name
which
i
have
the
honour
to
gave
a
little
stately
not
i
thought
her
to
be
at
bottom
a
noble
i
believe
that
she
is
capable
of
heroic
and
that
anything
dishonourable
would
be
repugnant
to
you
her
brought
this
with
he
opened
a
locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of
a
very
lovely
it
was
not
a
photograph
but
an
ivory
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
the
large
dark
and
the
exquisite
holmes
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
then
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
lord
young
lady
came
to
and
you
renewed
your
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last
london
i
met
her
several
became
engaged
to
and
have
now
married
i
a
considerable
fair
not
more
than
is
usual
in
my
of
remains
to
since
the
marriage
is
a
really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
naturally
did
you
see
miss
on
the
day
before
the
she
in
good
she
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
that
is
very
and
on
the
morning
of
the
was
as
bright
as
least
until
after
the
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
to
tell
the
i
saw
then
the
first
signs
that
i
had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just
a
little
the
incident
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
let
us
have
for
all
it
is
she
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
she
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
and
it
fell
over
into
the
there
was
a
moment's
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
yet
when
i
spoke
to
her
of
the
she
answered
me
and
in
the
on
our
way
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
you
say
that
there
was
a
gentleman
in
the
some
of
the
general
public
were
it
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife's
i
call
him
a
gentleman
by
but
he
was
quite
a
i
hardly
noticed
his
but
really
i
think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
returned
from
the
wedding
in
a
less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
what
did
she
do
on
her
father's
saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
who
is
her
is
her
she
is
an
american
and
came
from
california
with
confidential
little
too
much
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
of
in
america
they
look
upon
these
things
in
a
different
long
did
she
speak
to
this
a
few
i
had
something
else
to
think
did
not
overhear
what
they
simon
said
something
about
a
she
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
i
have
no
idea
what
she
slang
is
very
expressive
and
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
walked
into
the
your
she
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
she
rose
muttered
some
words
of
and
left
the
she
never
came
this
as
i
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
covered
her
bride's
dress
with
a
long
put
on
a
and
went
and
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
hyde
park
in
company
with
flora
a
woman
who
is
now
in
and
who
had
already
made
a
disturbance
at
house
that
i
should
like
a
few
particulars
as
to
this
young
and
your
relations
to
lord
simon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
have
been
on
a
friendly
footing
for
some
may
say
on
a
very
friendly
she
used
to
be
at
the
i
have
not
treated
her
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
but
you
know
what
women
flora
was
a
dear
little
but
exceedingly
and
devotedly
attached
to
she
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that
i
was
about
to
be
to
tell
the
the
reason
why
i
had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that
i
feared
lest
there
might
be
a
scandal
in
the
she
came
to
door
just
after
we
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
and
even
threatening
but
i
had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
and
i
had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
who
soon
pushed
her
out
she
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making
a
your
wife
hear
all
thank
she
did
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
that
is
what
of
scotland
looks
upon
as
so
it
is
thought
that
flora
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
it
is
a
possible
think
did
not
say
a
probable
but
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
do
not
think
flora
would
hurt
a
jealousy
is
a
strange
transformer
of
pray
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
i
came
to
seek
a
not
to
propound
i
have
given
you
all
the
since
you
ask
i
may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense
a
social
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
that
she
had
become
suddenly
when
i
consider
that
she
has
turned
her
will
not
say
upon
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
certainly
that
is
also
a
conceivable
said
lord
i
think
that
i
have
nearly
all
my
may
i
ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
then
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
to
detain
you
i
shall
communicate
with
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
said
our
have
solved
what
was
say
that
i
have
solved
is
my
is
a
detail
which
i
shall
speedily
lord
simon
shook
his
am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
he
and
bowing
in
a
manner
he
is
very
good
of
lord
simon
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on
a
level
with
his
said
sherlock
think
that
i
shall
have
a
whisky
and
soda
and
a
cigar
after
all
this
i
had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
dear
have
notes
of
several
similar
though
as
i
remarked
which
were
quite
as
my
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into
a
circumstantial
evidence
is
occasionally
very
as
when
you
find
a
trout
in
the
to
quote
i
have
heard
all
that
you
have
the
knowledge
of
cases
which
serves
me
so
there
was
a
parallel
instance
in
aberdeen
some
years
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
munich
the
year
after
the
it
is
one
of
these
here
is
you
will
find
an
extra
tumbler
upon
the
and
there
are
cigars
in
the
the
official
detective
was
attired
in
a
and
which
gave
him
a
decidedly
nautical
and
he
carried
a
black
canvas
bag
in
his
with
a
short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the
cigar
which
had
been
offered
to
asked
holmes
with
a
twinkle
in
his
look
i
feel
it
is
this
infernal
simon
marriage
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
you
surprise
ever
heard
of
such
a
mixed
every
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
i
have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made
said
holmes
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
i
have
been
dragging
the
heaven's
what
search
of
the
body
of
lady
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
you
dragged
the
basin
of
trafalgar
square
he
what
do
you
you
have
just
as
good
a
chance
of
finding
this
lady
in
the
one
as
in
the
shot
an
angry
glance
at
my
suppose
you
know
all
about
he
i
have
only
just
heard
the
but
my
mind
is
made
then
you
think
that
the
serpentine
plays
no
part
in
the
think
it
very
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
he
opened
his
bag
as
he
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor
a
of
watered
a
pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and
a
bride's
wreath
and
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
said
putting
a
new
upon
the
top
of
the
is
a
little
nut
for
you
to
master
said
my
blowing
blue
rings
into
the
dragged
them
from
the
they
were
found
floating
near
the
margin
by
a
they
have
been
identified
as
her
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
the
same
brilliant
every
man's
body
is
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
and
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
some
evidence
implicating
flora
in
the
am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
cried
with
some
am
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
you
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
this
dress
does
implicate
miss
flora
the
dress
is
a
in
the
pocket
is
a
in
the
is
a
and
here
is
the
very
he
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
to
will
see
me
when
all
is
come
at
now
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
lady
simon
was
away
by
flora
and
that
with
no
was
responsible
for
her
signed
with
her
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
said
really
are
very
fine
let
me
see
he
took
up
the
paper
in
a
listless
but
his
attention
instantly
became
and
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
is
indeed
said
you
find
it
i
congratulate
you
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
he
looking
at
the
wrong
the
this
is
the
right
right
you're
here
is
the
note
written
in
pencil
over
over
here
is
what
appears
to
be
the
fragment
of
a
hotel
which
interests
me
nothing
in
i
looked
at
it
said
rooms
breakfast
cocktail
lunch
glass
i
see
nothing
in
likely
it
is
most
all
the
as
to
the
it
is
important
or
at
least
the
initials
so
i
congratulate
you
wasted
time
said
believe
in
hard
work
and
not
in
sitting
by
the
fire
spinning
fine
and
we
shall
see
which
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
he
gathered
up
the
thrust
them
into
the
and
made
for
the
one
hint
to
drawled
holmes
before
his
rival
will
tell
you
the
true
solution
of
the
lady
simon
is
a
there
is
and
there
never
has
any
such
looked
sadly
at
my
then
he
turned
to
tapped
his
forehead
three
shook
his
head
and
hurried
he
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
holmes
rose
to
put
on
his
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
he
i
that
i
must
leave
you
to
your
papers
for
a
it
was
after
five
o'clock
when
sherlock
holmes
left
but
i
had
no
time
to
be
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived
a
man
with
a
very
large
flat
this
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of
a
youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
and
to
my
very
great
a
quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
there
were
a
couple
of
brace
of
cold
a
a
de
foie
gras
pie
with
a
group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
having
laid
out
all
these
my
two
visitors
vanished
like
the
genii
of
the
arabian
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
just
before
nine
o'clock
sherlock
holmes
stepped
briskly
into
the
his
features
were
gravely
but
there
was
a
light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
have
laid
the
he
rubbing
his
seem
to
expect
they
have
laid
for
i
fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
said
am
surprised
that
lord
simon
has
not
already
i
fancy
that
i
hear
his
step
now
upon
the
it
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
and
with
a
very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
messenger
reached
asked
and
i
confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
have
you
good
authority
for
what
you
best
lord
simon
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
will
the
duke
he
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
is
the
purest
i
cannot
allow
that
there
is
any
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
i
can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
having
no
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such
a
was
a
a
public
said
lord
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
placed
in
so
unprecedented
a
will
make
no
i
am
very
angry
and
i
have
been
shamefully
think
that
i
heard
a
said
there
are
steps
on
the
if
i
cannot
persuade
you
to
take
a
lenient
view
of
the
lord
i
have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
he
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in
a
lady
and
said
he
me
to
introduce
you
to
and
francis
hay
the
i
you
have
already
at
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
a
picture
of
offended
the
lady
had
taken
a
quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
it
was
as
well
for
his
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
said
i
guess
you
have
every
cause
to
make
no
apology
to
said
lord
simon
i
know
that
i
have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that
i
should
have
spoken
to
you
before
i
but
i
was
kind
of
and
from
the
time
when
i
saw
frank
here
again
i
just
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing
or
i
only
wonder
i
didn't
fall
down
and
do
a
faint
right
there
before
the
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
i
may
give
an
remarked
the
strange
had
just
a
little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
for
my
i
should
like
all
europe
and
america
to
hear
the
rights
of
he
was
a
sunburnt
with
a
sharp
face
and
alert
i'll
tell
our
story
right
said
the
here
and
i
met
in
in
near
the
where
pa
was
working
a
we
were
engaged
to
each
frank
and
but
then
one
day
father
struck
a
rich
pocket
and
made
a
while
poor
frank
here
had
a
claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
the
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
so
at
last
pa
wouldn't
hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
and
he
took
me
away
to
frank
wouldn't
throw
up
his
so
he
followed
me
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
frank
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
so
then
i
promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
shouldn't
we
be
married
right
said
then
i
will
feel
sure
of
and
i
won't
claim
to
be
your
husband
until
i
come
we
talked
it
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
with
a
clergyman
all
ready
in
that
we
just
did
it
right
and
then
frank
went
off
to
seek
his
and
i
went
back
to
next
i
heard
of
frank
was
that
he
was
in
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
and
then
i
heard
of
him
from
new
after
that
came
a
long
newspaper
story
about
how
a
camp
had
been
attacked
by
apache
and
there
was
my
name
among
the
i
fainted
dead
and
i
was
very
sick
for
months
pa
thought
i
had
a
decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
not
a
word
of
news
came
for
a
year
and
so
that
i
never
doubted
that
frank
was
really
then
lord
simon
came
to
and
we
came
to
and
a
marriage
was
and
pa
was
very
but
i
felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
if
i
had
married
lord
of
course
i'd
have
done
my
duty
by
we
can't
command
our
but
we
can
our
i
went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good
a
wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
but
you
may
imagine
what
i
felt
just
as
i
came
to
the
altar
i
glanced
back
and
saw
frank
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
i
thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
but
when
i
looked
again
there
he
was
with
a
kind
of
question
in
his
as
if
to
ask
me
whether
i
were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
i
wonder
i
didn't
i
know
that
everything
was
turning
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of
a
bee
in
my
i
didn't
know
what
to
should
i
stop
the
service
and
make
a
scene
in
the
i
glanced
at
him
and
he
seemed
to
know
what
i
was
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
then
i
saw
him
scribble
on
a
piece
of
and
i
knew
that
he
was
writing
me
a
as
i
passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out
i
dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
it
was
only
a
line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
of
course
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
and
i
determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
i
got
back
i
told
my
who
had
known
him
in
and
had
always
been
his
i
ordered
her
to
say
but
to
get
a
few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
i
know
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
lord
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
i
hadn't
been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before
i
saw
frank
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
he
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
i
slipped
put
on
my
and
followed
some
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
lord
simon
to
to
me
from
the
little
i
heard
as
if
he
had
a
little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
i
managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
we
got
into
a
cab
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
gordon
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
frank
had
been
a
prisoner
among
the
had
came
on
to
found
that
i
had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
followed
me
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
saw
it
in
a
explained
the
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
we
had
a
talk
as
to
what
we
should
and
frank
was
all
for
but
i
was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
sending
a
line
to
to
show
him
that
i
was
it
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
so
frank
took
my
and
things
and
made
a
bundle
of
so
that
i
should
not
be
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
it
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
paris
only
that
this
good
came
round
to
us
this
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than
i
can
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
frank
was
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
then
he
offered
to
give
us
a
chance
of
talking
to
lord
simon
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
you
have
heard
it
and
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
given
you
and
i
hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
lord
simon
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
but
had
listened
with
a
frowning
brow
and
a
compressed
lip
to
this
long
he
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
you
won't
forgive
you
won't
shake
hands
before
i
if
it
would
give
you
any
he
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
had
suggested
you
would
have
joined
us
in
a
friendly
think
that
there
you
ask
a
little
too
responded
his
may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
but
i
can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
i
think
that
with
your
permission
i
will
now
wish
you
all
a
very
he
included
us
all
in
a
sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
i
trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
said
sherlock
is
always
a
joy
to
meet
an
for
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of
a
monarch
and
the
blundering
of
a
minister
in
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
country
under
a
flag
which
shall
be
a
quartering
of
the
union
jack
with
the
stars
and
case
has
been
an
interesting
remarked
holmes
when
our
visitors
had
left
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
for
by
of
scotland
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
the
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within
a
few
minutes
of
returning
obviously
something
had
occurred
during
the
to
cause
her
to
change
her
what
could
that
something
she
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
had
she
seen
if
she
it
must
be
someone
from
america
because
she
had
spent
so
short
a
time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
you
see
we
have
already
by
a
process
of
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
then
who
could
this
american
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
it
might
be
a

might
be
a

young
womanhood
i
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
so
far
i
had
got
before
i
ever
heard
lord
when
he
told
us
of
a
man
in
a
of
the
change
in
the
bride's
of
so
transparent
a
device
for
obtaining
a
note
as
the
dropping
of
a
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
in
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has
a
prior
claim
whole
situation
became
absolutely
she
had
gone
off
with
a
and
the
man
was
either
a
lover
or
was
a
previous

being
in
favour
of
the
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
might
have
been
but
friend
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
the
initials
of
of
the
highest
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within
a
week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
london
did
you
deduce
the
the
select
eight
shillings
for
a
bed
and
for
a
glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
there
are
not
many
in
london
which
charge
at
that
in
the
second
one
which
i
visited
in
northumberland
i
learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
francis
an
american
had
left
only
the
day
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
i
came
upon
the
very
items
which
i
had
seen
in
the
duplicate
his
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
gordon
so
thither
i
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
i
ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position
a
little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
lord
simon
in
i
invited
them
to
meet
him
as
you
i
made
him
keep
the
with
no
very
good
i
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
said
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
i
think
that
we
may
judge
lord
simon
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
draw
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
the
adventure
of
the
beryl
coronet
said
i
as
i
stood
one
morning
in
our
looking
down
the
is
a
madman
coming
it
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
my
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
looking
over
my
it
was
a
crisp
february
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
down
the
centre
of
baker
street
it
had
been
ploughed
into
a
brown
crumbly
band
by
the
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
edges
of
the
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
the
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
but
was
still
dangerously
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
from
the
direction
of
the
metropolitan
station
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
he
was
a
man
of
about
and
with
a
strongly
marked
face
and
a
commanding
he
was
dressed
in
a
sombre
yet
rich
in
black
shining
neat
brown
and
yet
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
for
he
was
running
with
occasional
little
such
as
a
weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
as
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
waggled
his
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
i
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
believe
that
he
is
coming
said
rubbing
his
i
rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
i
think
that
i
recognise
the
did
i
not
tell
as
he
the
puffing
and
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
with
the
a
few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
still
still
but
with
so
fixed
a
look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
for
a
while
he
could
not
get
his
words
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
suddenly
springing
to
his
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
sherlock
holmes
pushed
him
down
into
the
sitting
beside
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
have
you
said
are
fatigued
with
your
pray
wait
until
you
have
recovered
and
then
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit

for
a
minute
or
more
with
a
heaving
fighting

he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
set
his
lips
and
turned
his
face
towards
doubt
you
think
me
said
see
that
you
have
had
some
great
responded
knows
i
trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
public
disgrace
i
might
have
although
i
am
a
man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne
a
private
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
but
the
two
coming
and
in
so
frightful
a
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
it
is
not

the
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
compose
said
let
me
have
a
clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
answered
our
probably
familiar
to
your
i
am
alexander
of
the
banking
firm
of
holder
of
threadneedle
the
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
city
of
what
could
have
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
london
to
this
most
pitiable
we
all
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
feel
that
time
is
of
said
is
why
i
hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that
i
should
secure
your
i
came
to
baker
street
by
the
underground
and
hurried
from
there
on
for
the
cabs
go
slowly
through
this
that
is
why
i
was
so
out
of
for
i
am
a
man
who
takes
very
little
i
feel
better
and
i
will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as
i
of
well
known
to
you
that
in
a
successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
one
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money
is
in
the
shape
of
where
the
security
is
we
have
done
a
good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
or
morning
i
was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when
a
card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
i
started
when
i
saw
the
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
perhaps
even
to
you
i
had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was
a
name
which
is
a
household
word
all
over
the
of
the
most
exalted
names
in
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
when
he
to
say
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through
a
disagreeable
said
have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
i
is
absolutely
essential
to
said
i
should
have
pounds
at
i
of
borrow
so
trifling
a
sum
ten
times
over
from
my
but
i
much
prefer
to
make
it
a
matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
in
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one's
self
under
how
may
i
do
you
want
this
i
monday
i
have
a
large
sum
due
to
and
i
shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
but
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
said
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
on
the
other
i
am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
then
in
justice
to
my
partner
i
must
insist
even
in
your
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
should
much
prefer
to
have
it
said
raising
up
a
black
morocco
case
which
he
had
laid
beside
his
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
beryl
of
the
most
precious
public
possessions
of
the
said
he
opened
the
and
in
lay
the
magnificent
piece
of
jewellery
which
he
had
are
enormous
said
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
the
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum
which
i
have
i
am
prepared
to
leave
it
with
you
as
my
took
the
precious
case
into
my
hands
and
looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
doubt
its
he
at
i
only
propriety
of
my
leaving
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
i
should
not
dream
of
doing
so
were
it
not
absolutely
certain
that
i
should
be
able
in
four
days
to
reclaim
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
is
the
security
that
i
am
giving
you
a
strong
proof
of
the
confidence
which
i
have
in
founded
upon
all
that
i
have
heard
of
i
rely
upon
you
not
only
to
be
discreet
and
to
refrain
from
all
gossip
upon
the
matter
above
to
preserve
this
coronet
with
every
possible
precaution
because
i
need
not
say
that
a
great
public
scandal
would
be
caused
if
any
harm
were
to
befall
any
injury
to
it
would
be
almost
as
serious
as
its
complete
for
there
are
no
in
the
world
to
match
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
i
leave
it
with
with
every
and
i
shall
call
for
it
in
person
on
monday
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
i
said
no
more
calling
for
my
i
ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
pound
when
i
was
alone
once
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
i
could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
it
was
a
national
a
horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
i
already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
so
i
locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
evening
came
i
felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious
a
thing
in
the
office
behind
safes
had
been
forced
before
and
why
should
not
mine
if
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which
i
should
find
i
that
for
the
next
few
days
i
would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
with
this
i
called
a
cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
carrying
the
jewel
with
i
did
not
breathe
freely
until
i
had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
now
a
word
as
to
my
for
i
wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
my
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
and
may
be
set
aside
i
have
three
who
have
been
with
me
a
number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
lucy
the
second
has
only
been
in
my
service
a
few
she
came
with
an
excellent
and
has
always
given
me
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
that
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
but
we
believe
her
to
be
a
thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
much
for
the
my
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
describe
i
am
a
widower
and
have
an
only
he
has
been
a
disappointment
to
grievous
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
am
myself
to
people
tell
me
that
i
have
spoiled
very
likely
i
when
my
dear
wife
died
i
felt
that
he
was
all
i
had
to
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for
a
moment
from
his
i
have
never
denied
him
a
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had
i
been
but
i
meant
it
for
the
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
but
he
was
not
of
a
business
he
was
to
speak
the
i
could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
when
he
was
young
he
became
a
member
of
an
aristocratic
and
having
charming
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of
a
number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
he
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
he
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
sir
george
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
i
could
not
wonder
that
such
a
man
as
sir
george
should
gain
an
influence
over
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
and
i
have
found
myself
that
i
could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
he
is
older
than
a
man
of
the
world
to
his
one
who
had
been
seen
a
brilliant
and
a
man
of
great
personal
yet
when
i
think
of
him
in
cold
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
i
am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which
i
have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
so
i
and
thinks
my
little
who
has
a
woman's
quick
insight
into
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
she
is
my
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world
i
adopted
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
she
is
a
sunbeam
in
my
a
wonderful
manager
and
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as
a
woman
could
she
is
my
right
i
do
not
know
what
i
could
do
without
in
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
twice
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
for
he
loves
her
but
each
time
she
has
refused
i
think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
but
it
is
too
too
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
and
i
shall
continue
with
my
miserable
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
that
night
after
i
told
arthur
and
mary
my
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
lucy
who
had
brought
in
the
i
am
left
the
but
i
cannot
swear
that
the
door
was
mary
and
arthur
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
but
i
thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
have
you
put
asked
my
own
i
hope
to
goodness
the
house
won't
be
burgled
during
the
said
is
locked
i
any
old
key
will
fit
that
when
i
was
a
youngster
i
have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
often
had
a
wild
way
of
so
that
i
thought
little
of
what
he
he
followed
me
to
my
that
night
with
a
very
grave
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
you
let
me
have
i
i
answered
have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
have
been
very
said
i
must
have
this
or
else
i
can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
a
very
good
i
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it
a
dishonoured
said
could
not
bear
the
i
must
raise
the
money
in
some
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
then
i
must
try
other
was
very
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
shall
not
have
a
farthing
from
i
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
he
was
gone
i
unlocked
my
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
and
locked
it
then
i
started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
duty
which
i
usually
leave
to
mary
but
which
i
thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
as
i
came
down
the
stairs
i
saw
mary
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as
i
said
i
a
little
you
give
the
leave
to
go
out
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
but
i
think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
must
speak
to
her
in
the
or
i
will
if
you
prefer
are
you
sure
that
everything
is
i
kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
where
i
was
soon
am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
but
i
beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which
i
do
not
make
the
your
statement
is
singularly
come
to
a
part
of
my
story
now
in
which
i
should
wish
to
be
particularly
i
am
not
a
very
heavy
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
no
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
about
two
in
the
i
was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
it
had
ceased
ere
i
was
wide
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though
a
window
had
gently
closed
i
lay
listening
with
all
my
to
my
there
was
a
distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly
in
the
next
i
slipped
out
of
all
palpitating
with
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
my
i
you
how
dare
you
touch
that
gas
was
half
as
i
had
left
and
my
unhappy
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
was
standing
beside
the
holding
the
coronet
in
his
he
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
or
bending
it
with
all
his
at
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
i
snatched
it
up
and
examined
one
of
the
gold
with
three
of
the
in
was
i
beside
myself
with
have
destroyed
you
have
dishonoured
me
where
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
he
i
shaking
him
by
the
are
none
there
cannot
be
any
said
are
three
and
you
know
where
they
must
i
call
you
a
liar
as
well
as
a
did
i
not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
have
called
me
names
said
will
not
stand
it
any
i
shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
i
will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
i
cried
with
grief
and
shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
shall
learn
nothing
from
said
he
with
a
passion
such
as
i
should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
you
choose
to
call
the
let
the
police
find
what
they
this
time
the
whole
house
was
for
i
had
raised
my
voice
in
my
mary
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
she
read
the
whole
story
with
a
fell
down
senseless
on
the
i
sent
the
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
when
the
inspector
and
a
constable
entered
the
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
i
answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
private
but
had
become
a
public
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
i
was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
said
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
it
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if
i
might
leave
the
house
for
five
you
may
get
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
said
and
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which
i
was
i
implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than
i
was
at
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise
a
scandal
which
would
convulse
the
he
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
may
as
well
face
the
said
have
been
caught
in
the
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
if
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
by

shall
be
forgiven

your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask

turning
away
from
me
with
a
i
saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
there
was
but
one
way
for
i
called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
a
search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
this
morning
he
was
removed
to
a
and
after
going
through
all
the
police
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
the
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
you
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
i
have
already
offered
a
reward
of
my
what
shall
i
i
have
lost
my
my
and
my
son
in
one
what
shall
i
he
put
a
hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
droning
to
himself
like
a
child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
some
few
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
you
receive
much
he
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
sir
george
has
been
several
times
no
one
i
you
go
out
much
in
mary
and
i
stay
at
we
neither
of
us
care
for
is
unusual
in
a
young
is
of
a
quiet
she
is
not
so
very
she
is
from
what
you
seems
to
have
been
a
shock
to
her
she
is
even
more
affected
than
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son's
can
we
have
when
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hardly
consider
that
a
conclusive
was
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
it
was
you
not
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
bless
you
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
but
it
is
too
heavy
a
what
was
he
doing
there
at
if
his
purpose
were
why
did
he
not
say
and
if
it
were
why
did
he
not
invent
a
his
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
there
are
several
singular
points
about
the
what
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
closing
his
bedroom
likely
as
if
a
man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake
a
what
did
they
of
the
disappearance
of
these
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
they
have
shown
extraordinary
the
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
my
dear
said
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
it
appeared
to
you
to
be
a
simple
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
consider
what
is
involved
by
your
you
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
at
great
to
your
opened
your
took
out
your
broke
off
by
main
force
a
small
portion
of
went
off
to
some
other
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
and
then
returned
with
the
other
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
i
ask
you
is
such
a
theory
what
other
is
cried
the
banker
with
a
gesture
of
his
motives
were
why
does
he
not
explain
is
our
task
to
find
that
replied
if
you
we
will
set
off
for
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing
a
little
more
closely
into
my
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
which
i
was
eager
enough
to
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
i
confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
but
still
i
had
such
faith
in
judgment
that
i
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
he
hardly
spoke
a
word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
sunk
in
the
deepest
our
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
and
he
even
broke
into
a
desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
a
short
railway
journey
and
a
shorter
walk
brought
us
to
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
was
a
square
house
of
white
standing
back
a
little
from
the
a
double
with
a
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
on
the
right
side
was
a
small
wooden
which
led
into
a
narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
and
forming
the
on
the
left
ran
a
lane
which
led
to
the
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
being
a
though
little
holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
across
the
down
the
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
so
long
was
he
that
holder
and
i
went
into
the
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
we
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
came
she
was
rather
above
the
middle
with
dark
hair
and
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in
a
woman's
her
were
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
as
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with
a
greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently
a
woman
of
strong
with
immense
capacity
for
disregarding
my
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with
a
sweet
womanly
have
given
orders
that
arthur
should
be
have
you
she
my
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
i
am
so
sure
that
he
is
you
know
what
woman's
instincts
i
know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
is
he
if
he
is
perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
could
i
help
suspecting
when
i
actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
it
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
arthur
in
shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
your
affection
for
arthur
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
far
from
hushing
the
thing
i
have
brought
a
gentleman
down
from
london
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
she
facing
round
to
his
he
wished
us
to
leave
him
he
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
stable
she
raised
her
dark
can
he
hope
to
find
i
is
i
that
you
will
succeed
in
what
i
feel
sure
is
the
that
my
cousin
arthur
is
innocent
of
this
fully
share
your
and
i
with
that
we
may
prove
returned
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
believe
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
miss
mary
might
i
ask
you
a
question
or
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
heard
nothing
yourself
last
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
i
heard
and
i
came
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
did
you
fasten
all
the
they
all
fastened
this
have
a
maid
who
has
a
i
think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle's
remarks
about
the
you
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
cried
the
banker
i
have
told
you
that
i
saw
arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
a
we
must
come
back
to
about
this
miss
you
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
i
when
i
went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night
i
met
her
slipping
i
saw
the
in
the
you
know
he
is
the
who
brings
our
vegetables
his
name
is
francis
said
the
left
of
the
is
to
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
he
he
is
a
man
with
a
wooden
something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady's
expressive
black
you
are
like
a
said
do
you
know
she
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
eager
should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
said
shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
perhaps
i
had
better
take
a
look
at
the
lower
windows
before
i
go
he
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
this
he
opened
and
made
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
we
shall
go
said
he
at
the
was
a
plainly
furnished
little
with
a
grey
a
large
and
a
long
holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
key
was
used
to
open
he
which
my
son
himself
of
the
cupboard
of
the
you
it
is
it
on
the
sherlock
holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
is
a
noiseless
said
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
this
i
contains
the
we
must
have
a
look
at
he
opened
the
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
it
was
a
magnificent
specimen
of
the
and
the
stones
were
the
finest
that
i
have
ever
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
was
a
cracked
where
a
corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
said
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
might
i
beg
that
you
will
break
it
the
banker
recoiled
in
should
not
dream
of
said
i
holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
but
without
feel
it
give
a
said
though
i
am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
an
ordinary
man
could
not
do
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if
i
did
break
there
would
be
a
noise
like
a
pistol
do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within
a
few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
do
not
know
what
to
it
is
all
dark
to
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
what
do
you
miss
confess
that
i
still
share
my
uncle's
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
we
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
with
your
i
shall
now
continue
my
investigations
he
went
at
his
own
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
might
make
his
task
more
for
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
think
that
i
have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
said
can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
the
where
are
cannot
the
banker
wrung
his
shall
never
see
them
he
my
you
give
me
opinion
is
in
no
way
for
god's
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
baker
street
rooms
morning
between
nine
and
ten
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
what
i
can
to
make
it
i
understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
provided
only
that
i
get
back
the
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum
i
may
would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
i
shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
it
is
just
possible
that
i
may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion's
mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than
i
could
even
dimly
several
times
during
our
homeward
journey
i
endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
until
at
last
i
gave
it
over
in
it
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
he
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in
a
few
minutes
dressed
as
a
common
with
his
collar
turned
his
seedy
his
red
and
his
worn
he
was
a
perfect
sample
of
the
think
that
this
should
said
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
but
i
fear
that
it
won't
i
may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
or
i
may
be
following
a
but
i
shall
soon
know
which
it
i
hope
that
i
may
be
back
in
a
few
he
cut
a
slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
i
had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
evidently
in
excellent
swinging
an
old
boot
in
his
he
chucked
it
down
into
a
corner
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
only
looked
in
as
i
said
am
going
right
to
the
other
side
of
the
west
it
may
be
some
time
before
i
get
don't
wait
up
for
me
in
case
i
should
be
are
you
getting
so
nothing
to
complain
i
have
been
out
to
since
i
saw
you
but
i
did
not
call
at
the
it
is
a
very
sweet
little
and
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
a
good
i
must
not
sit
gossiping
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
i
could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
his
eyes
and
there
was
even
a
touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
he
hastened
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
i
waited
until
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
so
i
retired
to
my
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon
a
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
i
do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
but
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with
a
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
as
fresh
and
trim
as
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
said
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
it
is
after
nine
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
i
thought
i
heard
a
it
our
friend
the
i
was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of
a
broad
and
massive
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
shade
he
entered
with
a
weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which
i
pushed
forward
for
do
not
know
what
i
have
done
to
be
so
severely
said
two
days
ago
i
was
a
happy
and
prosperous
without
a
care
in
the
now
i
am
left
to
a
lonely
and
dishonoured
one
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
my
has
deserted
her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
her
room
was
and
a
note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
i

sure
of
then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
knows
it
when
i
had
cleared
it
all
up
i
had
an
interview
with
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
i
told
it
to
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that
i
was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
your
news
of
this
may
open
his
heaven's
tell
what
is
this
extraordinary
will
do
and
i
will
show
you
the
steps
by
which
i
reached
and
let
me
say
to
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
sir
george
and
your
niece
they
have
now
fled
is
unfortunately
more
than
it
is
neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
ruined
an
absolutely
desperate
a
man
without
heart
or
your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
when
he
breathed
his
vows
to
as
he
had
done
to
a
hundred
before
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
the
devil
knows
best
what
he
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
and
i
will
believe
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
will
tell
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
your
when
you
as
she
gone
to
your
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
his
had
pressed
right
through
the
so
long
had
he
stood
she
told
him
of
the
his
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
and
he
bent
her
to
his
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of
a
lover
extinguishes
all
other
and
i
think
that
she
must
have
been
she
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
escapade
with
her
which
was
all
perfectly
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard
a
soft
tread
pass
his
so
he
rose
looking
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
petrified
with
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
and
in
the
light
of
the
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
she
passed
down
the
and
thrilling
with
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
he
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without
a
horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
but
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing
a
misfortune
this
would
be
for
and
how
it
was
to
set
it
he
rushed
just
as
he
in
his
bare
opened
the
sprang
out
into
the
and
ran
down
the
where
he
could
see
a
dark
figure
in
the
sir
george
tried
to
get
but
arthur
caught
and
there
was
a
struggle
between
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
and
his
opponent
at
the
in
the
your
son
struck
sir
george
and
cut
him
over
the
then
something
suddenly
and
your
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
rushed
closed
the
ascended
to
your
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
it
gasped
the
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
he
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
he
took
the
more
chivalrous
and
preserved
her
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
cried
my
what
a
blind
fool
i
have
and
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
the
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
how
cruelly
i
have
misjudged
i
arrived
at
the
continued
at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
i
knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
and
also
that
there
had
been
a
strong
frost
to
preserve
i
passed
along
the
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
just
beyond
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
a
woman
had
stood
and
talked
with
a
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had
a
wooden
i
could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
while
had
waited
a
and
then
had
gone
i
thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
i
passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
which
i
took
to
be
the
but
when
i
got
into
the
stable
lane
a
very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
was
a
double
line
of
tracks
of
a
booted
and
a
second
double
line
which
i
saw
with
delight
belonged
to
a
man
with
naked
i
was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
the
first
had
walked
both
but
the
other
had
run
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
i
followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
where
boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
then
i
walked
to
the
other
which
was
a
hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
i
saw
where
boots
had
faced
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been
a
where
a
few
drops
of
blood
had
to
show
me
that
i
was
not
boots
had
then
run
down
the
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
when
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
i
found
that
the
pavement
had
been
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
entering
the
i
as
you
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
and
i
could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
i
could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
i
was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
a
man
had
waited
outside
the
someone
had
brought
the
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
he
had
pursued
the
had
struggled
with
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
he
had
returned
with
the
but
had
left
a
fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
so
far
i
was
the
question
now
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
whatever
however
must
be
the
i
knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
but
if
it
were
the
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
there
could
be
no
possible
as
he
loved
his
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
more
so
as
the
secret
was
a
disgraceful
when
i
remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
my
conjecture
became
a
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
a
lover
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
i
knew
that
you
went
out
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was
a
very
limited
but
among
them
was
sir
george
i
had
heard
of
him
before
as
being
a
man
of
evil
reputation
among
it
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
even
though
he
knew
that
arthur
had
discovered
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
for
the
lad
could
not
say
a
word
without
compromising
his
own
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures
i
took
i
went
in
the
shape
of
a
loafer
to
sir
george's
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
at
the
expense
of
six
made
all
sure
by
buying
a
pair
of
his
with
these
i
journeyed
down
to
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted

an
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
said
it
was
i
found
that
i
had
my
so
i
came
home
and
changed
my
it
was
a
delicate
part
which
i
had
to
play
for
i
saw
that
a
prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
and
i
knew
that
so
astute
a
villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
i
went
and
saw
at
of
he
denied
but
when
i
gave
him
every
particular
that
had
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down
a
from
the
i
knew
my
and
i
clapped
a
pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
then
he
became
a
little
more
i
told
him
that
we
would
give
him
a
price
for
the
stones
he
pounds
that
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
dash

said
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the

soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
off
i
set
to
and
after
much
chaffering
i
got
our
stones
at
pounds
then
i
looked
in
upon
your
told
him
that
all
was
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two
after
what
i
may
call
a
really
hard
day's
day
which
has
saved
england
from
a
great
public
said
the
i
cannot
find
words
to
thank
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
your
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that
i
have
heard
of
and
now
i
must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which
i
have
done
as
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor

goes
to
my

inform

that
we
may
safely

is
pleasant
to
me

that
you
have
so
far
grasped
this
truth

in
these
little
records
of
our
cases
which
you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
i
am
bound
to
occasionally
to

given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
and
sensational
trials
in
which
i
have
figured

rather
to
those
incidents
which
may

colour

me

breakfast

me

after

which

had
sat
puffing
at

down
into

could
hardly
tell

his

for
the
days

at

criminal
has
lost
all
enterprise
and
as
to
my
own
little
it
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
an
agency
for
recovering
lost
lead
pencils
and
giving
advice
to
young
ladies
from
i
think
that
i
have
touched
bottom
at
this
note
i
had
this
morning
marks
my
i
read
he
tossed
a
crumpled
letter
across
to
it
was
dated
from
montague
place
upon
the
preceding
and
ran
am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether
i
should
or
should
not
accept
a
situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me
as
i
shall
call
at
ten
if
i
do
not
inconvenience
yours
you
know
the
young
i
is
ten
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
is
her
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
you
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
which
appeared
to
be
a
mere
whim
at
developed
into
a
serious
it
may
be
so
in
this
let
us
hope
but
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
for
unless
i
am
much
is
the
person
in
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
entered
the
she
was
plainly
but
neatly
with
a
quick
freckled
like
a
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of
a
woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
will
excuse
my
troubling
i
am
said
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
i
have
had
a
very
strange
and
as
i
have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom
i
could
ask
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what
i
should
take
a
miss
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
anything
that
i
can
to
serve
i
could
see
that
holmes
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
he
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
and
then
composed
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
to
listen
to
her
have
been
a
governess
for
five
said
the
family
of
colonel
spence
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
in
nova
and
took
his
children
over
to
america
with
so
that
i
found
myself
without
a
i
and
i
answered
but
without
at
last
the
little
money
which
i
had
saved
began
to
run
and
i
was
at
my
wit's
end
as
to
what
i
should
is
a
agency
for
governesses
in
the
west
end
called
and
there
i
used
to
call
about
once
a
week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
but
it
is
really
managed
by
miss
she
sits
in
her
own
little
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
when
i
called
last
week
i
was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
but
i
found
that
miss
was
not
a
prodigiously
stout
man
with
a
very
smiling
face
and
a
great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with
a
pair
of
glasses
on
his
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
as
i
came
in
he
gave
quite
a
jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
miss
will
said
could
not
ask
for
anything
he
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
he
was
such
a
man
that
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
are
looking
for
a
he
what
salary
do
you
had
pounds
a
month
in
my
last
place
with
colonel
spence
he
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like
a
man
who
is
in
a
boiling
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful
a
sum
to
a
lady
with
such
attractions
and
may
be
less
than
you
said
little
a
little
and
he
is
all
quite
beside
the
the
point
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of
a
there
it
is
in
a
if
you
have
you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of
a
child
who
may
some
day
play
a
considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
but
if
you
have
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
your
salary
with
would
commence
at
pounds
a
may
that
to
destitute
as
i
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
the
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
opened
a
and
took
out
a
is
also
my
said
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful
a
as
i
was
already
in
debt
to
my
the
advance
was
a
great
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know
a
little
more
before
i
quite
committed
i
ask
where
you
said
charming
rural
the
copper
five
miles
on
the
far
side
of
it
is
the
most
lovely
my
dear
young
and
the
dearest
old
my
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
they
would
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with
a
three
gone
before
you
could
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
was
a
little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child's
but
the
father's
laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
sole
i
to
take
charge
of
a
single
not
the
not
the
my
dear
young
he
duty
would
as
i
am
sure
your
good
sense
would
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as
a
lady
might
with
propriety
you
see
no
should
be
happy
to
make
myself
in
dress
for
we
are
you
but
if
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
said
considerably
astonished
at
his
to
sit
or
sit
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
could
hardly
believe
my
as
you
may
my
hair
is
somewhat
and
of
a
rather
peculiar
tint
of
it
has
been
considered
i
could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
am
afraid
that
that
is
quite
said
he
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
and
i
could
see
a
shadow
pass
over
his
face
as
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
said
is
a
little
fancy
of
my
and
you
fancies
must
be
and
so
you
won't
cut
your
i
really
could
i
answered
very
then
that
quite
settles
the
it
is
a
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
in
that
miss
i
had
best
inspect
a
few
more
of
your
young
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without
a
word
to
either
of
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that
i
could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost
a
handsome
commission
through
my
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
she
you
miss
it
seems
rather
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
said
she
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening
for
to
miss
she
struck
a
gong
upon
the
and
i
was
shown
out
by
the
when
i
got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
i
began
to
ask
myself
whether
i
had
not
done
a
very
foolish
after
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
very
few
governesses
in
england
are
getting
pounds
a
what
use
was
my
hair
to
many
people
are
improved
by
wearing
it
short
and
perhaps
i
should
be
among
the
next
day
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
i
had
made
a
and
by
the
day
after
i
was
sure
of
i
had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when
i
received
this
letter
from
the
gentleman
i
have
it
here
and
i
will
read
it
to
copper
near
miss
has
very
kindly
given
me
your
and
i
write
from
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
reconsidered
your
my
wife
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
for
she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description
of
we
are
willing
to
give
pounds
a
or
pounds
a
so
as
to
recompense
you
for
any
little
inconvenience
which
our
fads
may
cause
they
are
not
very
after
my
wife
is
fond
of
a
particular
shade
of
electric
blue
and
would
like
you
to
wear
such
a
dress
indoors
in
the
you
need
go
to
the
expense
of
purchasing
as
we
have
one
belonging
to
my
dear
daughter
alice
in
which
i
should
fit
you
very
as
to
sitting
here
or
or
amusing
yourself
in
any
manner
that
need
cause
you
no
as
regards
your
it
is
no
doubt
a
especially
as
i
could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
remain
firm
upon
this
and
i
only
hope
that
the
increased
salary
may
recompense
you
for
the
your
as
far
as
the
child
is
are
very
now
do
try
to
and
i
shall
meet
you
with
the
at
let
me
know
your
yours
is
the
letter
which
i
have
just
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that
i
will
accept
i
that
before
taking
the
final
step
i
should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
miss
if
your
mind
is
made
that
settles
the
said
you
would
not
advise
me
to
confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which
i
should
like
to
see
a
sister
of
mine
apply
is
the
meaning
of
it
i
have
no
i
cannot
perhaps
you
have
yourself
formed
some
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
seemed
to
be
a
very
is
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is
a
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
is
a
possible
as
matters
it
is
the
most
probable
but
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
nice
household
for
a
young
the
the
of
course
the
pay
is
that
is
what
makes
me
why
should
they
give
you
pounds
a
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
there
must
be
some
strong
reason
thought
that
if
i
told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if
i
wanted
your
i
should
feel
so
much
stronger
if
i
felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
i
assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
there
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
what
danger
do
you
holmes
shook
his
head
would
cease
to
be
a
danger
if
we
could
define
said
at
any
day
or
a
telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
is
she
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
shall
go
down
to
hampshire
quite
easy
in
my
mind
i
shall
write
to
at
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
and
start
for
winchester
with
a
few
grateful
words
to
holmes
she
bade
us
both
and
bustled
off
upon
her
said
i
as
we
heard
her
firm
steps
descending
the
seems
to
be
a
young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
she
would
need
to
said
holmes
am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
it
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend's
prediction
was
a
fortnight
went
during
which
i
frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
the
unusual
the
curious
the
light
all
pointed
to
something
though
whether
a
fad
or
a
or
whether
the
man
were
a
philanthropist
or
a
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
as
to
i
observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
when
i
mentioned
he
cried
can't
make
bricks
without
and
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such
a
the
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as
i
was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
holmes
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
when
i
would
leave
him
stooping
over
a
retort
and
a
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
he
opened
the
yellow
and
glancing
at
the
threw
it
across
to
look
up
the
trains
in
said
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
the
summons
was
a
brief
and
urgent
be
at
the
black
swan
hotel
at
winchester
at
midday
it
i
am
at
my
wit's
you
come
with
asked
glancing
should
wish
look
it
is
a
train
at
said
glancing
over
my
is
due
at
winchester
at
will
do
very
then
perhaps
i
had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
by
eleven
o'clock
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
english
holmes
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
but
after
we
had
passed
the
hampshire
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
it
was
an
ideal
spring
a
light
blue
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
the
sun
was
shining
very
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
which
set
an
edge
to
a
man's
all
over
the
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
they
not
fresh
and
i
cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
a
man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
baker
but
holmes
shook
his
head
you
said
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of
a
mind
with
a
turn
like
mine
that
i
must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
you
look
at
these
scattered
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
i
look
at
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is
a
feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
i
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
always
fill
me
with
a
certain
it
is
my
founded
upon
my
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
london
do
not
present
a
more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
horrify
the
reason
is
very
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
cannot
there
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of
a
tortured
or
the
thud
of
a
drunkard's
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that
a
word
of
complaint
can
set
it
and
there
is
but
a
step
between
the
crime
and
the
but
look
at
these
lonely
each
in
its
own
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
think

which
of
these

no

for

had
engaged
a

our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
am
so
delighted
that
you
have
she
said

so
very
kind
of
you
but
indeed
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
your
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
tell
us
what
has
happened
to

do
and
i
must
be
for
i
have
promised
to
be
back
before
i
got
his
leave
to
come

though
he
little
knew
for
what
us
have
everything
in
its
due
holmes
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
the
first
i
may
say
that
i
have
on
the
with
no
actual
from
and
it
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
but
i
cannot
understand
and
i
am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
can
you
not
reasons
for
their
but
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
when
i
came
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
to
the
copper
it
as
he
beautifully
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
for
it
is
a
large
square
block
of
a
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
there
are
grounds
round
woods
on
three
and
on
the
fourth
a
field
which
slopes
down
to
the
southampton
which
curves
past
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
front
this
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
lord
a
clump
of
copper

in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
was
driven
over
by
my
who
was
as
amiable
as
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
there
was
no
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
baker
is
not
i
found
her
to
be
a
much
younger
than
her
not
more
than
i
should
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
from
their
conversation
i
have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
that
he
was
a
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
as
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
i
can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father's
young
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
she
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
she
was
a
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
her
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
he
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
boisterous
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be
a
happy
and
yet
she
had
some
secret
this
she
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
more
than
once
i
have
surprised
her
in
i
have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
for
i
have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
a
little
he
is
small
for
his
with
a
head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
his
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
giving
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
little
and
but
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
the
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
am
glad
of
all
remarked
my
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
the
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
which
struck
me
at
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
there
are
only
a
man
and
his
for
that
is
his
is
a
uncouth
with
grizzled
hair
and
and
a
perpetual
smell
of
twice
since
i
have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
and
yet
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
his
wife
is
a
very
tall
and
strong
woman
with
a
sour
as
silent
as
and
much
less
they
are
a
most
unpleasant
but
fortunately
i
spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
copper
my
life
was
very
on
the
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
said
turning
to
are
very
much
obliged
to
miss
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
i
assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
we
shall
now
see
how
the
dress
will
become
you
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
dress
which
i
found
waiting
for
me
was
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
it
was
of
excellent
a
sort
of
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
it
could
not
have
been
a
better
fit
if
i
had
been
measured
for
both
and
expressed
a
delight
at
the
look
of
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
they
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
which
is
a
very
large
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
a
chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
with
its
back
turned
towards
in
this
i
was
asked
to
and
then
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
began
to
tell
me
a
series
of
the
funniest
stories
that
i
have
ever
listened
you
cannot
imagine
how
comical
he
and
i
laughed
until
i
was
quite
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
never
so
much
as
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
and
a
anxious
look
upon
her
after
an
hour
or
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
and
that
i
might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
edward
in
the
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
again
i
changed
my
again
i
sat
in
the
and
again
i
laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
and
which
he
told
then
he
handed
me
a
and
moving
my
chair
a
little
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
i
read
for
about
ten
beginning
in
the
heart
of
a
and
then
in
the
middle
of
a
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
can
easily
how
curious
i
became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
they
were
always
very
i
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
so
that
i
became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
but
i
soon
devised
a
my
had
been
so
a
happy
thought
seized
and
i
concealed
a
piece
of
the
glass
in
my
on
the
next
in
the
midst
of
my
i
put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
and
was
able
with
a
little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
i
confess
that
i
was
there
was
at
least
that
was
my
first
at
the
second
i
perceived
that
there
was
a
man
standing
in
the
southampton
a
small
bearded
man
in
a
grey
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
the
road
is
an
important
and
there
are
usually
people
this
was
leaning
against
the
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
i
lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
most
searching
she
said
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that
i
had
a
mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
she
rose
at
said
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
miss
friend
of
miss
he
i
know
no
one
in
these
how
very
kindly
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
kindly
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
did
as
i
was
and
at
the
same
instant
drew
down
the
that
was
a
week
and
from
that
time
i
have
not
sat
again
in
the
nor
have
i
worn
the
blue
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
said
narrative
promises
to
be
a
most
interesting
will
find
it
rather
i
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which
i
on
the
very
first
day
that
i
was
at
the
copper
took
me
to
a
small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
as
we
approached
it
i
heard
the
sharp
rattling
of
a
and
the
sound
as
of
a
large
animal
moving
in
said
showing
me
a
slit
between
two
he
not
a
looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
and
of
a
vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
be
said
my
laughing
at
the
start
which
i
had
only
my
i
call
him
but
really
old
my
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
we
feed
him
once
a
and
not
too
much
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
toller
lets
him
loose
every
and
god
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
for
sake
don't
you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
for
it's
as
much
as
your
life
is
warning
was
no
idle
for
two
nights
later
i
happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two
o'clock
in
the
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
i
was
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
when
i
was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
as
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine
i
saw
what
it
it
was
a
giant
as
large
as
a
tawny
with
hanging
black
and
huge
projecting
it
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
that
dreadful
sentinel
sent
a
chill
to
my
heart
which
i
do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
now
i
have
a
very
strange
experience
to
tell
i
as
you
cut
off
my
hair
in
and
i
had
placed
it
in
a
great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
one
after
the
child
was
in
i
began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
there
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
the
lower
one
i
had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
and
as
i
had
still
much
to
pack
away
i
was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
it
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by
a
mere
so
i
took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
the
very
first
key
fitted
to
and
i
drew
the
drawer
there
was
only
one
thing
in
but
i
am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
it
was
my
coil
of
took
it
up
and
examined
it
was
of
the
same
peculiar
and
the
same
but
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
how
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
with
trembling
hands
i
undid
my
turned
out
the
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
i
laid
the
two
tresses
and
i
assure
you
that
they
were
was
it
not
puzzle
as
i
i
could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
i
returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
and
i
said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
as
i
felt
that
i
had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening
a
drawer
which
they
had
am
naturally
as
you
may
have
and
i
soon
had
a
pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
there
was
one
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
a
door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
opened
into
this
but
it
was
invariably
one
as
i
ascended
the
i
met
coming
out
through
this
his
keys
in
his
and
a
look
on
his
face
which
made
him
a
very
different
person
to
the
jovial
man
to
whom
i
was
his
cheeks
were
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
he
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without
a
word
or
a
aroused
my
so
when
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
i
strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which
i
could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
there
were
four
of
them
in
a
three
of
which
were
simply
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
they
were
evidently
all
as
i
strolled
up
and
glancing
at
them
came
out
to
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
said
must
not
think
me
rude
if
i
passed
you
without
a
my
dear
young
i
was
preoccupied
with
business
assured
him
that
i
was
not
the
said
seem
to
have
quite
a
suite
of
spare
rooms
up
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
looked
surprised
as
it
seemed
to
a
little
startled
at
my
is
one
of
my
said
have
made
my
dark
room
up
dear
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
who
would
have
believed
who
would
have
ever
believed
he
spoke
in
a
jesting
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
i
read
suspicion
there
and
but
no
from
the
moment
that
i
understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which
i
was
not
to
i
was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
it
was
not
mere
though
i
have
my
share
of
it
was
more
a
feeling
of
feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
they
talk
of
woman's
perhaps
it
was
woman's
instinct
which
gave
me
that
at
any
it
was
and
i
was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
i
may
tell
you
besides
both
toller
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
and
i
once
saw
him
carrying
a
large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
recently
he
has
been
drinking
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
and
when
i
came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
and
were
both
and
the
child
was
with
so
that
i
had
an
admirable
i
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
opened
the
and
slipped
was
a
little
passage
in
front
of
and
which
turned
at
a
right
angle
at
the
farther
round
this
corner
were
three
doors
in
a
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
they
each
led
into
an
empty
dusty
and
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
the
centre
door
was
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
padlocked
at
one
end
to
a
ring
in
the
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
the
door
itself
was
locked
as
and
the
key
was
not
this
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
and
yet
i
could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
evidently
there
was
a
skylight
which
let
in
light
from
as
i
stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
i
suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw
a
shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
a
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
my
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
and
i
turned
and
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
i
rushed
down
the
through
the
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
who
was
waiting
said
was
i
thought
that
it
must
be
when
i
saw
the
door
i
am
so
i
dear
young
my
dear
young
cannot
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
what
has
frightened
my
dear
young
his
voice
was
just
a
little
too
he
i
was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
i
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that
i
was
frightened
and
ran
out
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
said
looking
at
me
what
did
you
i
do
you
think
that
i
lock
this
am
sure
that
i
do
not
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
do
you
he
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
am
sure
if
i
had
you
know
and
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into
a
grin
of
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of
a
throw
you
to
the
was
so
terrified
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
i
suppose
that
i
must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
i
remember
nothing
until
i
found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
then
i
thought
of
i
could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
i
was
frightened
of
the
of
the
of
the
of
the
even
of
the
they
were
all
horrible
to
if
i
could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
of
course
i
might
have
fled
from
the
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
my
mind
was
soon
made
i
would
send
you
a
i
put
on
my
hat
and
went
down
to
the
which
is
about
half
a
mile
from
the
and
then
feeling
very
much
a
horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as
i
approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
but
i
remembered
that
toller
had
drunk
himself
into
a
state
of
insensibility
that
and
i
knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
i
slipped
in
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
winchester
this
but
i
must
be
back
before
three
for
and
are
going
on
a
and
will
be
away
all
the
so
that
i
must
look
after
the
now
i
have
told
you
all
my
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
above
what
i
should
holmes
and
i
had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
my
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
his
hands
in
his
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
toller
still
he
i
heard
his
wife
tell
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
is
and
the
go
out
there
a
cellar
with
a
good
strong
the
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like
a
very
brave
and
sensible
miss
do
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
i
should
not
ask
it
of
you
if
i
did
not
think
you
a
quite
exceptional
will
what
is
shall
be
at
the
copper
by
seven
my
friend
and
the
will
be
gone
by
that
and
toller
we
be
there
only
remains
who
might
give
the
if
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
you
would
facilitate
matters
will
do
we
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
of
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
you
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
that
is
as
to
who
this
prisoner
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
miss
alice
if
i
remember
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
you
were
as
resembling
her
in
and
the
colour
of
your
hers
had
been
cut
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
and
of
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
by
a
curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
the
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
her
no
as
you
wore
the
girl's
dress
and
were
so
like
he
was
convinced
from
your
whenever
he
saw
and
afterwards
from
your
that
miss
was
perfectly
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
the
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
so
much
is
fairly
the
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
i
dear
you
as
a
medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of
a
child
by
the
study
of
the
don't
you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
i
have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
this
child's
disposition
is
abnormally
merely
for
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
as
i
should
or
from
his
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
am
sure
that
you
are
cried
our
thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
must
be
for
we
are
dealing
with
a
very
cunning
we
can
do
nothing
until
seven
at
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
we
were
as
good
as
our
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
copper
having
put
up
our
trap
at
a
wayside
the
group
of
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
miss
hunter
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
you
managed
asked
a
loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
is
toller
in
the
said
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
here
are
his
which
are
the
duplicates
of
have
done
well
cried
holmes
with
lead
the
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
we
passed
up
the
unlocked
the
followed
on
down
a
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
miss
hunter
had
holmes
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
then
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
but
without
no
sound
came
from
and
at
the
silence
face
clouded
trust
that
we
are
not
too
said
miss
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
put
your
shoulder
to
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
cannot
make
our
way
it
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
together
we
rushed
into
the
it
was
there
was
no
furniture
save
a
little
pallet
a
small
and
a
basketful
of
the
skylight
above
was
and
the
prisoner
has
been
some
villainy
said
beauty
has
guessed
miss
intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
the
we
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
he
swung
himself
up
onto
the
he
the
end
of
a
long
light
ladder
against
the
that
is
how
he
did
it
is
said
miss
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
went
has
come
back
and
done
i
tell
you
that
he
is
a
clever
and
dangerous
i
should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step
i
hear
now
upon
the
i
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
a
very
fat
and
burly
with
a
heavy
stick
in
his
miss
hunter
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
but
sherlock
holmes
sprang
forward
and
confronted
said
your
the
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
and
then
up
at
the
open
is
for
me
to
ask
you
he
spies
and
i
have
caught
have
you
are
in
my
i'll
serve
he
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
gone
for
the
cried
miss
have
my
said
close
the
front
cried
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
we
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of
a
and
then
a
scream
of
with
a
horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
an
elderly
man
with
a
red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at
a
side
he
has
loosed
the
it's
not
been
fed
for
two
or
it'll
be
too
holmes
and
i
rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
with
toller
hurrying
behind
there
was
the
huge
famished
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
running
i
blew
its
brains
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
with
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
living
but
horribly
into
the
we
laid
him
upon
the
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
toller
to
bear
the
news
to
his
i
did
what
i
could
to
relieve
his
we
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
and
a
gaunt
woman
entered
the
cried
miss
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
it
is
a
pity
you
didn't
let
me
know
what
you
were
for
i
would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
said
looking
keenly
at
is
clear
that
toller
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
i
and
i
am
ready
enough
to
tell
what
i
sit
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which
i
must
confess
that
i
am
still
in
the
will
soon
make
it
clear
to
said
i'd
have
done
so
before
now
if
i
could
got
out
from
the
if
there's
business
over
you'll
remember
that
i
was
the
one
that
stood
your
and
that
i
was
miss
friend
was
never
happy
at
miss
alice
from
the
time
that
her
father
married
she
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
fowler
at
a
friend's
as
well
as
i
could
miss
alice
had
rights
of
her
own
by
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
she
that
she
never
said
a
word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
he
knew
he
was
safe
with
but
when
there
was
a
chance
of
a
husband
coming
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put
a
stop
on
he
wanted
her
to
sign
a
so
that
whether
she
married
or
he
could
use
her
when
she
wouldn't
do
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
then
she
got
better
at
all
worn
to
a
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
but
that
didn't
make
no
change
in
her
young
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
said
think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
and
that
i
can
deduce
all
that
i
took
to
this
system
of
brought
miss
hunter
down
from
london
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
was
fowler
being
a
persevering
as
a
good
seaman
should
blockaded
the
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
metallic
or
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
fowler
was
a
very
said
toller
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
and
that
a
ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
have
just
as
it
am
sure
we
owe
you
an
said
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
and
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
so
i
that
we
had
best
escort
miss
hunter
back
to
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
now
is
rather
a
questionable
and
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
in
front
of
the
but
was
always
a
broken
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
they
still
live
with
their
old
who
probably
know
so
much
of
past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
fowler
and
miss
were
by
special
in
southampton
the
day
after
their
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of

government
appointment

my
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her

once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
and
she
is
now
the
head
of
